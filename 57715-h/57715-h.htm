<p><span class="uppercase">t</span> the beginning of last year, at the request of Messrs.
Sampson Low and Co., I began to prepare a work in
which, under the title of <cite>Footsteps of Dr. Johnson</cite>, I
was to describe the various places that he had either
inhabited or visited. It was to be copiously illustrated with views.
I had made considerable progress with my task when I saw that
its extent required that it should be divided into two separate
works. Scotland in itself afforded ample materials for at least a
single volume. In this opinion I was confirmed by my friend
Mr. Lancelot Speed, the artist who was to prepare the illustrations.
My publishers yielded to our advice and allowed us to confine
ourselves entirely to that country. The materials which I had got
together for England and Wales I have put on one side, in the
hope that the present venture will prove sufficiently successful to
encourage author, artist, and publishers alike to follow it up with a
companion work.</p>

<p>Of Johnson’s journey through Scotland we have three different
accounts, his <cite>Letters to Mrs. Thrale</cite>, his <cite>Journey to the Western
Islands</cite>, and Boswell’s <cite>Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides</cite>. In
writing his <cite>Journey</cite> he may have had before him the letters which
he had written on the spot. Many interesting circumstances,
however, which he mentioned in them he omitted in his formal
narrative. Boswell’s <cite>Journal</cite>, though published ten years after
Johnson’s work, was written first; and it was not only written, but
it was published before the publication of the <cite>Letters</cite>. His single
account, therefore, and Johnson’s two accounts are independent
narratives. It would have been easy to weave all three together
into one work, and to have done nothing more. It went, however,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_viii" id="Page_viii">{viii}</a></span>
against the grain with me to make a mixture of that sort. The
plan which I have pursued has been much more laborious; but it
will, I trust, commend itself both to “the gentle reader”&mdash;who is,
I take it, a somewhat indolent reader&mdash;and also to the student of
the manners and customs of a past age. Of all history there was
no part which Johnson held equal in value to the history of
manners. With this judgment my own taste leads me to agree.
I take far greater interest in the daily life, the briars and roses of
the working-day world as it was known to our forefathers, than in
all the conquests of Chatham and of Clive. I have made, therefore,
the attempt to bring before my readers the Scotland which
Johnson saw, the Scotland which he had expressly come to study.
“The wild objects” which he said he wished to see I have not
neglected, but here I trust chiefly to Mr. Speed’s art. “The
peculiar manners” which interested him far more than natural
objects have been my special study. Even before I took the
present work in hand I had examined them somewhat closely;
but last summer, on my return from Scotland, in a quiet recess of
the Bodleian Library, I carried my inquiries a good deal farther.
In covering so large an extent of ground and in such a mass of
details it is idle to hope that no error has been made. I can
honestly say that I have done my best to be accurate.</p>

<p>The country which Johnson traversed is famous for other footsteps
besides his. I have called in the earlier and later travellers to
add interest to the scene, and I have thrown in anecdotes with a
liberal hand. “I love anecdotes,” he said. To Boswell’s descriptions
of the men with whom he associated I have often been able
to add a great deal from memoirs and other books to which that
writer had not access; I have gathered some few traditions of the
<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sassenach mohr</i>, the big Englishman, which still linger in the
Highlands and the Hebrides.</p>

<p>The tour in which I followed his course I was forced to divide
into two parts. Beginning at Inverness I went first through the
Western Highlands and the Hebrides, and so southwards through
Glasgow to Auchinleck, Boswell’s home in Ayrshire. Later on I
visited Edinburgh and its neighbourhood, and completed my task
by going northwards to Inverness. I mention this to guard against
any apparent inaccuracy in dates which might be discovered in my
narrative. I cannot pretend to have seen every place which
Johnson saw; but those spots which I passed by are few in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_ix" id="Page_ix">{ix}</a></span>
number. In the former part of my trip I was fortunate enough
to have Mr. Speed for my companion; but over the latter part of
the ground we had, to my regret, to travel at different times. Like
Boswell he had done much “to counteract the inconveniences of
travel.”</p>

<p>I have the pleasant duty of expressing my acknowledgments
for the kindness with which I was received and for the assistance
which was given me in my inquiries. Most of all am I indebted
to the Rev. Roderick Macleod, of Macleod, Vicar of Bolney,
who, by the numerous introductions with which he honoured me,
greatly facilitated my progress in the Isle of Skye. To his father
Macleod of Macleod, and his aunt, Miss Macleod of Macleod, I am
under great obligations. My thanks are due also to the Duke of
Argyle; the Earl of Cawdor; the Earl of Erroll; Sir Charles
Dalrymple, of New Hailes; Captain Burnett, of Monboddo
House; Mr. Macleane of Lochbuie; Mr. John Lorne Stewart, Laird
of Coll; Mr. J. Maitland Anderson, Librarian of the University
of St. Andrews; Mr. G. J. Campbell, of Inverness; Mr. P. M.
Cran, the City Chamberlain, and Mr. William Gordon, the Town
Clerk of Aberdeen; Mr. Lachlan Mackintosh, of Old Lodge,
Elgin; Dr. Paterson, of Clifton Bank, St. Andrews; Professor
Stephenson, of the University of Aberdeen; Mr. A. E. Stewart, of
Raasay; and to my friend Mr. G. J. Burch, B.A., Librarian of the
Institution of Civil Engineers, for some time the Compiler of the
Subject Catalogue in the Bodleian Library.</p>

<p>To my friend, General Cadell, C.B., of Cockenzie House, I owe
the sketches of the ruins of Ballencrieff, and of a group of ash-trees
which were said to have been planted on Johnson’s suggestion.</p>

<p>Both at Inverary Castle and at Dunvegan Castle I was allowed
to have photographs taken not only of the rooms, but also of the
interesting portraits of the former owners who had been Johnson’s
hosts.</p>

<p>To the Rev. Alexander Matheson, minister of Glenshiel, who
came many miles over the mountains to help me with his knowledge
as a local antiquary, I am, alas! too late in bringing my
acknowledgments. It was with great regret that early in the
spring I learnt of the sudden death of this amiable man.</p>

<p>I have once more the pleasure of giving my thanks to Mr. G.
K. Fortescue, Superintendent of the Reading Room of the British
Museum, who does so much to lighten the labours of the student.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_x" id="Page_x">{x}</a></span></p>

<p>Should any of my readers be able to add to the traditions of
Johnson which I have collected, or to throw light on any of the
questions which I have investigated I trust that they will honour
me with their communications. Hope comes to all, and a second
edition of these <cite>Footsteps</cite> is within the range of possibility. In it
their kindness shall meet with proper acknowledgment.</p>

<p><span class="uppercase">traveller</span> who passed through the Hebrides in the
year 1786 recorded that in many houses he was given
the room to sleep in which had been occupied by Dr.
Johnson.<a name="FNanchor_1_2" id="FNanchor_1_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_2" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> Twenty-eight years later, when Sir Walter
Scott with some of his friends
landed in Skye, it was found
on inquiry that the first
thought which had come into
each man’s mind was of Johnson’s
Latin Ode to Mrs.
Thrale.<a name="FNanchor_2_3" id="FNanchor_2_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_3" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> The Highlanders at
Dunvegan, Scott goes on to
say, saw that about Johnson
there was something worthy
of respect, “they could not
tell what, and long spoke of
him as the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sassenach mohr</i>,
or big Englishman.”<a name="FNanchor_3_4" id="FNanchor_3_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_4" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> He
still lives among them, mainly,
no doubt, by his own and
Boswell’s books, but partly
also by tradition. Very few
of the houses remain where
he visited. Nevertheless, in
two of these in the Hebrides, and in one in the Lowlands, I was
shown his bedroom. Proud, indeed, would the old man have been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
could he have foreseen that an Englishman who followed on his
steps one hundred and sixteen years later would be shown at New
Hailes, at Rasay, and at Dunvegan, “Dr. Johnson’s Chamber.”
At Rasay is preserved his walking-stick&mdash;not the famous “piece
of timber” which was destined for some museum, but was stolen or
lost in Mull, but one which he had occasionally used. In his bedroom
an engraving of him hangs on the wall. The china tea-set
out of which he had drunk is preserved by a descendant of the laird
who was his host. At Dunvegan his portrait is set up in a post of
honour in the noble drawing-room of the famous old castle, and his
autograph letter to Macleod of Macleod rests among the ancient
memorials of that still more ancient family. That it is endorsed
“Dr. Johnston’s Letter” may be twisted into a compliment. So
popular was he that his very name was “Scottified.”</p>

<p class="caption center">DR. JOHNSON’S BEDROOM, DUNVEGAN.</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">TRADITIONS OF JOHNSON.</div>

<p>In many places I found traditions of him still remaining&mdash;some,
no doubt, true; others false. But whether false or true, by their
vitality they show the deep mark which the man made as he passed
along. In Glenmorison there are countryfolk who profess to know
by the report of their forefathers the “clear rivulet” in “the narrow
valley, not very flowery but sufficiently verdant,” where Johnson
reposed on “a bank such as a writer of romance might have delighted
to feign, and first conceived the thought of the narration”
of his tour.<a name="FNanchor_4_5" id="FNanchor_4_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_5" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> In a farmhouse on Loch Duich, just below the mountain
which exhausted his patience and good-humour, and nearly exhausted
his strength, I was told of the speech which he made as he
reached the top of the pass. “He turned as he was beginning the
descent, and said to the mountain, ‘Good-bye, Ma’am Rattachan, I
hope never to see your face again.’”<a name="FNanchor_5_6" id="FNanchor_5_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_6" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> From Rasay a friendly correspondent
wrote to tell me how the great man had climbed up Dun
Can, the highest mountain in the island, and had danced on the top.
I have pointed out that it was Boswell and not Johnson who performed
this feat, but the tradition, doubtless, will linger on. At
Dunvegan Miss Macleod of Macleod, who remembers her grandmother,
Johnson’s hostess, and her aunts, “the four daughters, who
knew all the arts of southern elegance, and all the modes of English
economy,”<a name="FNanchor_6_7" id="FNanchor_6_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_7" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> has preserved some traditions more worthy of trust.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
“One day,” she said, “he had scolded the maid for not getting
good peats, and had gone out in the rain to the stack to fetch in
some himself.<a name="FNanchor_7_8" id="FNanchor_7_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_8" class="fnanchor">[7]</a> He caught a bad cold. Lady Macleod went up
to his room to see
how he was, and found
him in bed, with his
wig turned inside out,
and the wrong end
foremost, serving the
purpose of ‘a cap by
night,’ like the stocking
of Goldsmith’s
<cite>Author</cite>. On her return
to the drawing-room,
she said, ‘I
have often seen very
plain people, but anything
as ugly as Dr.
Johnson, with his wig
thus stuck on, I never
have seen.’<a name="FNanchor_8_9" id="FNanchor_8_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_9" class="fnanchor">[8]</a> She was
(her granddaughter
added) greatly pleased
with his talk, for she
had seen enough of
the world to enjoy it;
but her daughters, who
were still quite girls,
disliked him much,
and called him a bear.”</p>

<p>At the inn at
Broadford, sitting in
the entrance-hall, I
fell into talk with an
elderly man, a retired exciseman, who lived close by. He, too,
had his traditions of the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sassenach mohr</i>. His father had known<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">{4}</a></span>
an old lady, blind of one eye, who was fond of telling how in her
childhood, at the time of Johnson’s visit, she had been watching the
dancing in that famous farmhouse of Corrichatachin, where Boswell
got so drunk one night over the punch, and so penitent the next
morning over a severe headache and the Epistle for the Twentieth
Sunday after Trinity.<a name="FNanchor_9_10" id="FNanchor_9_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_10" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> A large brass button on the coat-tail of one
of the dancers had struck her in her eye as he whirled round and
had so injured it that she lost the sight. My informant had a
story also to tell of the learned minister, the Rev. Donald Macqueen,
who accompanied Johnson in part of his tour. “A crofter
seeing the two men pass, asked the minister who was his companion.
Macqueen replied, ‘The man who made the English
language.’ ‘Then he had very little to do,’ rejoined the crofter;
meaning, according to the Gaelic idiom, that he might have been
much better employed.” My friendly exciseman had known also
an old lady who remembered Johnson coming to her father’s house
in Mull. According to a custom once very common in the Highlands,
though even in those days passing fast away, she had been
sent for three or four years to a shepherd’s hut to be fostered. It
was shortly after her return home that Johnson’s visit was paid.
He did not hide his displeasure at the roughness which still clung
to her. She had not forgotten, moreover, how he found fault with
the large candles, rudely made of pieces of old cloth twisted round
and dipped in tallow.<a name="FNanchor_10_11" id="FNanchor_10_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_11" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> My acquaintance ended his talk by saying:
“If Dr. Johnson had returned to Scotland after publishing his
book, he would have got a crack on his skull.”</p>

<p>At Craignure, in the Isle of Mull, the landlord of the little inn
had his story to tell of the untimely death of young Maclean of
Col, that “amiable man,” who, while the pages of Johnson’s <cite>Journey
to the Western Islands</cite> “were preparing to attest his virtues, perished
in the passage between Ulva and Inch-Kenneth.”<a name="FNanchor_11_12" id="FNanchor_11_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_12" class="fnanchor">[11]</a> My host’s great-grandmother,
a Macquarrie of Ulva, on the night when the boat
was upset, had been watching the cattle near the fatal shore. An
old woman who was to have been her companion had failed her, so
that she was alone. She saw nothing, and heard no cries. “A<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
half-witted person,” my informant added, in a serious voice, “had
warned one of the party not to go; but his warning was not heeded,
and the man lost his life.”</p>

<div class="figcenter w500">
<img src="images/illus_018.jpg" width="500" height="324" alt="" />
<div class="caption">SOUND OF ULVA.</div>
</div>

<p>At Lochbuie two traditions, I found, had been preserved in the
family of the laird, the great-grandson of that Maclean of Lochbuie
whom Boswell had heard described as “a great roaring braggadocio,”
but found only “a bluff, comely, noisy old gentleman. He
bawled out to Johnson (as Boswell tells us), ‘Are you of the Johnstons
of Glencroe or of Ardnamurchan?’ Dr. Johnson gave him a
significant look, but made no answer.”<a name="FNanchor_12_13" id="FNanchor_12_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_13" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> The report has come down
in the family that Johnson replied that he was neither one nor the
other. Whereupon Lochbuie cried out, “Damn it, Sir, then you
must be a bastard.” There can, I fear, be no doubt that this rejoinder
belongs to those <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">excellens impromptus à loisir</i> in which
Rousseau excelled<a name="FNanchor_13_14" id="FNanchor_13_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_14" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>&mdash;that <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">esprit de l’escalier</i>, as the French describe
it. If the laird, like Addison, could draw for a thousand pounds,
he had, I suspect, but nine pence in ready money.<a name="FNanchor_14_15" id="FNanchor_14_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_15" class="fnanchor">[14]</a> For had this
repartee been made at the time, and not been merely an after-invention,
Boswell most certainly would not have let it pass unrecorded.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">{6}</a></span>
The second tradition is scarcely more trustworthy. Johnson
at the tea-table, I was told, helped himself to sugar with his
fingers, whereupon Lady Lochbuie at once had the basin emptied,
and fresh sugar brought in. He said nothing at the time, but
when he had finished his tea he flung down the cup, exclaiming
that if he had polluted one he had also polluted the other. A lady
of the family of Lochbuie, whose memory goes back ninety years,
in recounting this story when I was in Scotland, added, “But I do
not know whether it was true.” That it was not true I have
little doubt. In the first place, we have again Boswell’s silence;
in the second place, to the minor decencies of life Johnson was by
no means inattentive. At Paris he was on the point of refusing a
cup of coffee because the footman had put in the sugar with his
fingers; and at Edinburgh, in a passion, he threw a glass of
lemonade out of the window because it had been sweetened in the
same manner by the waiter. In one of his letters to Mrs. Thrale
he expressed his displeasure in Skye at the very practice with
which he is charged a few weeks later in Mull. Describing his
visit to the house of Sir Alexander Macdonald, he wrote: “The
lady had not the common decencies of her tea-table: we picked up
our sugar with our fingers.”<a name="FNanchor_15_16" id="FNanchor_15_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_16" class="fnanchor">[15]</a></p>

<p>It is strange that while in Mull, that “most dolorous country,”
that “gloom of desolation,” as Johnson described it, these stories of
him are preserved, the boatman who took me across the narrow
passage between it and Inch-Kenneth had no traditionary knowledge
of his host, Sir Allan Maclean, and of his retirement in that
little island. To the forefathers of the men of Mull the head of
the Macleans would have been an object of reverence and even of
fear, and Johnson only a passing wonder. “I would cut my bones
for him,” said one of his clan, speaking of Sir Allan in Boswell’s
hearing.<a name="FNanchor_16_17" id="FNanchor_16_17"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_17" class="fnanchor">[16]</a> But of the Highland chief who lived among them no
remembrance remains, while the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Sassenach mohr</i>, who spent but a
few days in the island-home of the Macleans, is still almost “a
household word.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCOTTISH SENSITIVENESS.</div>

<p>I was indeed surprised to find through the Highlands and the
Hebrides how much he still remained in men’s thoughts. On Loch
Lomond, the boatman who rowed me to the islands on which he had
landed, a man of reading and intelligence, said that though he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">{7}</a></span>
himself read Johnson’s <cite>Journey</cite>, yet “Scotchmen still feel too sore
to like reading him.” Whatever soreness still lingers is, I have
little doubt, much more due to his sarcasms recorded by Boswell
than to any passages in his own narrative. But it is surprising that
Scotchmen cannot more generally join in a hearty laugh at his
humorous sallies, though they are at their own expense. That
the Scotch of a hundred years and more ago were over-sensitive is
not astonishing. At that time in most respects they were still far
behind England. It was England that they were striving to follow in
their arts, their commerce, and their agriculture. It was the English
accent that they were striving to catch, and the English style in
which they laboured to write. It was to the judgment of Englishmen
that their authors, no small or inglorious band, anxiously
appealed. That they should be sensitive to criticism beyond even
the Americans of our day was not unnatural. For in the poverty
of their soil, and the rudiments of their manufactures and trade,
they found none of that boastful comfort which supports the citizen
of the United States, even when he is most solicitous of English
approbation. But at the present day, when they are in most
respects abreast of Englishmen, and in some even ahead, they
should disprove the charge that is brought against them of wanting
humour by showing that they can enjoy a hearty laugh, even
though it goes against them. Johnson’s ill-humour did not go
deep, and, no doubt, was often laughed away. Of that rancour
which disgraced Hume his nature was wholly incapable. He
wished no ill to Scotland as Hume wished ill to England.<a name="FNanchor_17_18" id="FNanchor_17_18"></a><a href="#Footnote_17_18" class="fnanchor">[17]</a> “He
returned from it,” writes Boswell, “in great good-humour, with his
prejudices much lessened, and with very grateful feelings of the
hospitality with which he was treated.”<a name="FNanchor_18_19" id="FNanchor_18_19"></a><a href="#Footnote_18_19" class="fnanchor">[18]</a></p>

<p>Not all Scotch critics were hostile towards him. The <cite>Scots
Magazine</cite>, which last century was to Edinburgh what the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> was to London, always spoke of him with great
respect. Writing of him early in the year in which he visited
Scotland, it says:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Johnson has long possessed a splendid reputation in the republic of letters,
and it was honestly acquired. He is said to affect a singularity in his manners and
to contemn the social rules which are established in the intercourse of civil life. If
this extravagance is affected, it is a fault; if it has been acquired by the habitudes<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">{8}</a></span>
of his temper and his indolence, it scarcely merits censure. We allow to the man
who can soar so high above the multitude to descend sometimes beneath them.”<a name="FNanchor_19_20" id="FNanchor_19_20"></a><a href="#Footnote_19_20" class="fnanchor">[19]</a></p></div>

<p>In the two reviews of his <cite>Journey</cite> in the same magazine, there
is not one word of censure; neither when Boswell, eleven years
later, brought out his account of the tour, had they any fault to find.
In the character which they drew of Johnson on his death they
leave unnoticed his attacks on Scotland. They are even generous
in their praise. Speaking of his pension they say: “It would
have been a national disgrace if such talents, distinguished by such
writings, had met with no other recompense than the empty consciousness
of fame.”<a name="FNanchor_20_21" id="FNanchor_20_21"></a><a href="#Footnote_20_21" class="fnanchor">[20]</a> There were also men of eminence in Scotland
who at once acknowledged the merits of the book. “I love
the benevolence of the author,” said Lord Hailes.<a name="FNanchor_21_22" id="FNanchor_21_22"></a><a href="#Footnote_21_22" class="fnanchor">[21]</a> The “virtuous
and candid Dempster,” the “patriotic Knox,” Tytler, the historian,
“a Scot, if ever a Scot there were,” had each his word of high
praise.<a name="FNanchor_22_23" id="FNanchor_22_23"></a><a href="#Footnote_22_23" class="fnanchor">[22]</a> Sir Walter Scott, writing many years later, said: “I am
far from being of the number of those angry Scotsmen who imputed
to Johnson’s national prejudices all or a great part of the report he
has given of our country. I remember the Highlands ten or twelve
years later, and no one can conceive of how much that could have
been easily remedied travellers had to complain.”<a name="FNanchor_23_24" id="FNanchor_23_24"></a><a href="#Footnote_23_24" class="fnanchor">[23]</a></p>

<p>These men, nevertheless, formed a small minority. The outcry
that was raised against Johnson was at once loud and bitter.
To attacks for many a long year he had been used, but yet this
time he was startled. “He expressed his wonder at the extreme
jealousy of the Scotch, and their resentment at having their country
described as it really was.”<a name="FNanchor_24_25" id="FNanchor_24_25"></a><a href="#Footnote_24_25" class="fnanchor">[24]</a> Boswell mentions “the brutal
reflections thrown out against him,” and “the rancour with which
he was assailed by numbers of shallow irritable North Britons.”<a name="FNanchor_25_26" id="FNanchor_25_26"></a><a href="#Footnote_25_26" class="fnanchor">[25]</a>
How quickly the storm gathered and burst is shown in a letter
written by an Englishman from Edinburgh a few days after the
book was published:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Edinburgh, Jan. 24, 1775. Dr. Johnson’s <cite>Tour</cite> has just made its appearance
here, and has put the country into a flame. Everybody finds some reason to be
affronted. A thousand people who know not a single creature in the Western Isles
interest themselves in their cause, and are offended at the accounts that are given
of them. Newspapers, magazines, pamphlets, all teem with abuse of the Doctor.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">{9}</a></span>
He was received with the most flattering marks of civility by everyone. He was
looked upon as a kind of miracle, and almost carried about for a show. Those
who were in his company were silent the moment he spoke, lest they should
interrupt him, and lose any of the good things he was going to say. He repaid all
their attention to him with ill-breeding, and when in the company of the ablest
men in this country, who are certainly his superiors in point of abilities, his whole
design was to show them how contemptibly he thought of them. Had the Scotch
been more acquainted with Dr. Johnson’s private character they would have
expected nothing better. A man of illiberal manners and surly disposition, who all
his life long had been at enmity with the Scotch, takes a sudden resolution of
travelling amongst them; not, according to his own account, ‘to find a people of
liberal and refined education, but to see wild men and wild manners.’”<a name="FNanchor_26_27" id="FNanchor_26_27"></a><a href="#Footnote_26_27" class="fnanchor">[26]</a></p></div>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS ON JOHNSON.</div>

<p>The “patriotic Knox,” as Boswell calls him, the author of <cite>A
Tour through the Highlands and Hebride Isles in 1786</cite>, a man
freer from prejudices than the common run, and one who readily
acknowledged the merits of Johnson’s book, bears equal witness
to the wrath of his countrymen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Johnson (he writes) set out under incurable impressions of a national prejudice,
a religious prejudice, and a literary jealousy. From a writer of such abilities
and such prejudices the natives of Scotland had reason to expect a shower of arrows
without mercy, and it was possibly from this prepossession that they were ready to
fall upon him as one man the moment that his book appeared. Their minds were
charged with sentiments of indignity, resentment and revenge, which they did not
fail to discharge upon his head in whole platoons from every quarter.”<a name="FNanchor_27_28" id="FNanchor_27_28"></a><a href="#Footnote_27_28" class="fnanchor">[27]</a></p></div>

<p>To us, who know Johnson better than we know any other
author who has ever lived, the charge of literary jealousy seems
ridiculous. But Knox lived before Boswell’s <cite>Life</cite> was published.
Scotland, in which learning and even literature had slumbered for
nearly a century, had started up from her long sleep, and was bent
on turning the Auld Reekie into the Modern Athens. All her
geese were swans, though of swans she had at this season a fair
flock. “Edinburgh is a hotbed of genius,” wrote Smollett, shortly
before Johnson’s visit, and as a proof of it he instanced among
“authors of the first distinction,” Wallace, Blair, Wilkie, and Ferguson.
Hume still earlier had proclaimed that at last there was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">{10}</a></span>
“a hope of seeing good tragedies in the English language,” for
Johnny Home had written his <cite>Douglas</cite>. Wilkie of the <cite>Epigoniad</cite>,
the great historian held, was to be the Homer, and Blacklock the
Pindar, of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_28_29" id="FNanchor_28_29"></a><a href="#Footnote_28_29" class="fnanchor">[28]</a> But it was in Ossian Macpherson that the
hopes of the country had at one time soared highest. By Dr.
Blair, the Edinburgh Professor of Rhetoric, he had been ranked
with Homer and Virgil.<a name="FNanchor_29_30" id="FNanchor_29_30"></a><a href="#Footnote_29_30" class="fnanchor">[29]</a> The national pride, the honour of Scotland,
was concerned, and the meanest motive was attributed to the
man who had ventured to pronounce his poems an impudent forgery.
Macpherson was a dangerous enemy. Against “the
menaces of a ruffian” a thick cudgel might avail; but the secret
arts of a literary forger were not so easily baffled. His position
was one of great power, for from the Court he received a pension
at first of £600 a year, and afterwards of £800, “to supervise the
newspapers. He inserted what lies he pleased, and prevented
whatever he disapproved of being printed.”<a name="FNanchor_30_31" id="FNanchor_30_31"></a><a href="#Footnote_30_31" class="fnanchor">[30]</a> It was from this
tainted source that no doubt sprang many of “the miserable cavillings
against the <cite>Journey</cite> in newspapers, magazines, and other fugitive
pieces.”<a name="FNanchor_31_32" id="FNanchor_31_32"></a><a href="#Footnote_31_32" class="fnanchor">[31]</a> These, as Boswell tells us, “only furnished Johnson
with sport.” Nevertheless, though they did not trouble his mind,
they marred the fame of his book, and prejudiced not only the immediate,
but even the traditional judgment of Scotland. Enough
dirt was thrown, and some of it did stick and sticks still. Lies
were sent wandering through the land, and some of them have not
even yet found their everlasting rest. One disgusting story, not unworthy
of the inventive genius of Ossian himself, is still a solace to
Scots of the baser sort. That it is a lie can be plainly proved, for
it rests on a supposed constant suspicion in Johnson of the food
provided for him. Now we know from his own writings that only
twice in his tour had he “found any reason to complain of a Scottish
table.”<a name="FNanchor_32_33" id="FNanchor_32_33"></a><a href="#Footnote_32_33" class="fnanchor">[32]</a> Moreover, in his letters to Mrs. Thrale and in Boswell’s
<cite>Journal</cite>, we can follow his course with great accuracy and
minuteness. Had there been any foundation for this lie it must be
found on the road between Inverness and the seashore. Now we
know what meals he had at each station. Even in the miserable
inn at Glenelg, where his accommodation was at its worst, if he had
chosen he could have had mutton chops and freshly-killed poultry.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">{11}</a></span>
Finding both too tough, he supped on a lemon and a piece of
bread.</p>

<div class="sidenote">M’NICOL’S SCURRILOUS VOLUME.</div>

<p>The attacks of the angry critics, published as they were in fugitive
pieces, might have been forgotten had they not been revived
three or four years later in “a scurrilous volume,” as Boswell justly
describes it, “larger than Johnson’s own, filled with malignant
abuse under a name real or fictitious of some low man in an obscure
corner of Scotland, though supposed to be the work of another
Scotchman, who has found means to make himself well known both
in Scotland and England.”<a name="FNanchor_33_34" id="FNanchor_33_34"></a><a href="#Footnote_33_34" class="fnanchor">[33]</a> The “low man” was the Rev. Donald
M’Nicol, and the “obscure corner” that long and pleasant island
of Lismore which the steamers skirt every summer day as they
pass with their load of tourists between Oban and the entrance of
the Caledonian Canal. M’Nicol’s predecessor in the manse was the
Rev. John Macaulay, whose famous grandson, Lord Macaulay, was
to rebuke those “foolish and ignorant Scotchmen, who moved to
anger by a little unpalatable truth which was mingled with much
eulogy in the <cite>Journey to the Western Islands</cite>, assailed him whom they
chose to consider as the enemy of their country with libels much
more dishonourable to their country than anything that he had ever
said or written.”<a name="FNanchor_34_35" id="FNanchor_34_35"></a><a href="#Footnote_34_35" class="fnanchor">[34]</a> When Johnson was shown M’Nicol’s book he said:
“This fellow must be a blockhead. They don’t know how to go
about their abuse. Who will read a five shilling book against me?
No, Sir, if they had wit, they should have kept pelting me with
pamphlets.” The book, however, seems to have been widely read,
and in the year 1817 was reprinted at Glasgow in a fine large type.
A Scotch gentleman recently told me that he fears that to many of his
countrymen Johnson’s tour is only known through M’Nicol’s attack.</p>

<div class="sidenote">OSSIAN MACPHERSON.</div>

<p>It was Macpherson at whom Boswell aimed a blow when he
wrote of the “other Scotchman whose work it was supposed to be.”
If Ossian had no hand in it himself, it was certainly written by
someone fired with all his hatred of the man who had branded him
as a forger. Johnson is described as “a man of some reputation
for letters, whose master-passion was hatred of Scotland. When
the <cite>Poems of Ossian</cite> were published, and became the delight and
admiration of the learned over all Europe, his cynical disposition
instantly took the alarm.”<a name="FNanchor_35_36" id="FNanchor_35_36"></a><a href="#Footnote_35_36" class="fnanchor">[35]</a> It was from this time that “we may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">{12}</a></span>
date the origin of his intended tour to Scotland.” It was from
malice that he started so late in the year&mdash;a malice, by the way,
which nearly brought him to a watery grave. “It was not beauties
he went to find out in Scotland, but defects; and for the northern
situation of the Hebrides the advanced time of the year suited his
purpose best.”<a name="FNanchor_36_37" id="FNanchor_36_37"></a><a href="#Footnote_36_37" class="fnanchor">[36]</a> Johnson, with a discretion which other travellers
in like circumstances would do well to imitate, had passed over
Edinburgh with the remark that it is “a city too well known to
admit description.” This wise reticence is twisted into a proof
of malevolence. So, too, is the brevity with which he mentions
Dundee. “We stopped awhile at Dundee,” he recorded, “where
I remember nothing remarkable.”<a name="FNanchor_37_38" id="FNanchor_37_38"></a><a href="#Footnote_37_38" class="fnanchor">[37]</a> Surely this is a very innocent
sentence. Even Boswell, whose record was generally far fuller,
dismisses this place with three words. “We saw Dundee,” he
says.<a name="FNanchor_38_39" id="FNanchor_38_39"></a><a href="#Footnote_38_39" class="fnanchor">[38]</a> But M’Nicol at once discovered the miserable jealousy of
the Englishman. “He passes very rapidly through the town of
Dundee, for fear, I suppose, of being obliged to take notice of its
increasing trade.”<a name="FNanchor_39_40" id="FNanchor_39_40"></a><a href="#Footnote_39_40" class="fnanchor">[39]</a> How delicately Johnson treated this town in
his published narrative is shown by his description of it in his
private letter to Mrs. Thrale. To her he had written: “We
came to Dundee, a dirty despicable town.”<a name="FNanchor_40_41" id="FNanchor_40_41"></a><a href="#Footnote_40_41" class="fnanchor">[40]</a> Much as M’Nicol belaboured
Johnson, he could not refrain from claiming him as of
Scotch origin. “We are much deceived by fame,” he wrote, “if a
very near ancestor of his, who was a native of that country, did not
find to his cost that a tree was not quite such a rarity in his days.”<a name="FNanchor_41_42" id="FNanchor_41_42"></a><a href="#Footnote_41_42" class="fnanchor">[41]</a>
This mysterious hero of the gallows was no doubt no Johnson at
all, but a Johnston&mdash;of Ardnamurchan, probably, or of Glencroe.<a name="FNanchor_42_43" id="FNanchor_42_43"></a><a href="#Footnote_42_43" class="fnanchor">[42]</a></p>

<p>M’Nicol is ingenious in his treatment of the great Ossian controversy.
“The poems,” he says, “must be the production either
of Ossian or Mr. Macpherson. Dr. Johnson does not vouchsafe to
tell us who else was the author, and consequently the national
claim remains perfectly entire. The moment Mr. Macpherson
ceases to be admitted as a translator, he instantly acquires a title to
the original.”<a name="FNanchor_43_44" id="FNanchor_43_44"></a><a href="#Footnote_43_44" class="fnanchor">[43]</a> Granted that he was a ruffian who had tried by
menaces to hinder the detection of a cheat. What of that? He
was a great original ruffian, and his cheat was a work of great<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">{13}</a></span>
original genius. So that Caledonia, if she had one forger the more,
had not one poet the less. She made up in genius what she lost in
character. But this Dr. Johnson failed to see, being, poor man,
“naturally pompous and vain, and ridiculously ambitious of an exclusive
reputation in letters.” It must have been this same pomposity,
vanity, and ambition which led him to say of these poems:
“Sir, a man might write such stuff for ever, if he would <em>abandon</em>
his mind to it.”<a name="FNanchor_44_45" id="FNanchor_44_45"></a><a href="#Footnote_44_45" class="fnanchor">[44]</a></p>

<div class="figcenter w500">
<img src="images/illus_019.jpg" width="500" height="483" alt="" />
<div class="caption">GLENCROE.</div>
</div>

<p>That Johnson’s narrative should have roused resentment is not
surprising. Even his friend Beattie, “much as he loved and
revered him,” yet found in it “some asperities that seem to be the
effect of national prejudice.”<a name="FNanchor_45_46" id="FNanchor_45_46"></a><a href="#Footnote_45_46" class="fnanchor">[45]</a> That “this true-born Englishman,”
as Boswell delights to call him, should have given a wholly unprejudiced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">{14}</a></span>
account of any country not his own was an impossibility.
As regards Scotland, the position which he took certainly admitted
of justification. “When I find,” he said, “a Scotchman to whom an
Englishman is as a Scotchman, that Scotchman shall be as an Englishman
to me.”<a name="FNanchor_46_47" id="FNanchor_46_47"></a><a href="#Footnote_46_47" class="fnanchor">[46]</a> Boswell, and perhaps Boswell alone, exactly answered
this requirement, and the two men were fast friends. For many other
Scotchmen, indeed, he had strong feelings of regard, and even of
friendship&mdash;for Andrew Millar the bookseller, for William Strahan
the printer, for Blair, Beattie, John Campbell, Hailes, and Robertson,
among authors, and for his poor assistants in the great work of
his Dictionary, who all came from across the Tweed. There was
no want of individual affection, no John Bull disinclination that had
to be overcome in the case of each fresh acquaintance which he
made. His “was a prejudice of the head and not of the heart.”<a name="FNanchor_47_48" id="FNanchor_47_48"></a><a href="#Footnote_47_48" class="fnanchor">[47]</a>
He held that the Scotch, with that clannishness which is found in
almost equal strength in the outlying parts of the whole island,
in Cornwall and in Cumberland, achieved for themselves in England
“a success which rather exceeded the due proportion of their real
merit.”<a name="FNanchor_48_49" id="FNanchor_48_49"></a><a href="#Footnote_48_49" class="fnanchor">[48]</a> Jesting with a friend from Ireland, who feared “he
might treat the people of that country more unfavourably than he
had done the Scotch,” he answered, “Sir, you have no reason to
be afraid of me. The Irish are not in a conspiracy to cheat the
world by false representations of the merits of their countrymen.
No, Sir: the Irish are a <em>fair people</em>;&mdash;they never speak well of one
another.”<a name="FNanchor_49_50" id="FNanchor_49_50"></a><a href="#Footnote_49_50" class="fnanchor">[49]</a> To Boswell he began a letter, not meant, of course, for
the public eye, by saying: “Knowing as you do the disposition
of your countrymen to tell lies in favour of each other.”<a name="FNanchor_50_51" id="FNanchor_50_51"></a><a href="#Footnote_50_51" class="fnanchor">[50]</a> When he
came to write his <cite>Journey</cite>, he was led neither by timidity nor false
delicacy to conceal what he thought. He attacks that “national
combination so invidious that their friends cannot defend it,” which
is one of the means whereby Scotchmen “find, or make their way to
employment, riches, and distinction.”<a name="FNanchor_51_52" id="FNanchor_51_52"></a><a href="#Footnote_51_52" class="fnanchor">[51]</a> He upbraids that “vigilance
of jealousy which never goes to sleep,”<a name="FNanchor_52_53" id="FNanchor_52_53"></a><a href="#Footnote_52_53" class="fnanchor">[52]</a> which sometimes led them
to cross the borders of boastfulness and pass into falsehood, when
Caledonia was their subject and Englishmen their audience.
“A Scotchman,” he writes, “must be a very sturdy moralist
who does not love Scotland better than truth; he will always love
it better than inquiry.”<a name="FNanchor_53_54" id="FNanchor_53_54"></a><a href="#Footnote_53_54" class="fnanchor">[53]</a> Even in his talk when among Scotchmen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">{15}</a></span>
he was inclined “to expatiate rather too strongly upon the benefits
derived to their country from the Union.”<a name="FNanchor_54_55" id="FNanchor_54_55"></a><a href="#Footnote_54_55" class="fnanchor">[54]</a> “‘We have taught
you,’ said he, ‘and we’ll do the same in time to all barbarous
nations, to the Cherokees, and at last to the Ouran-Outangs,’
laughing with as much glee as if Monboddo had been present.
<span class="smcap">Boswell.</span> ‘We had wine before the Union.’ <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> ‘No, Sir;
you had some weak stuff, the refuse of France, which would not
make you drunk.’ <span class="smcap">Boswell.</span> ‘I assure you, Sir, there was a great
deal of drunkenness.’ <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> ‘No, Sir; there were people who
died of dropsies, which they contracted in trying to get drunk.’”<a name="FNanchor_55_56" id="FNanchor_55_56"></a><a href="#Footnote_55_56" class="fnanchor">[55]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ATTACKS ON THE HIGHLANDERS.</div>

<p>Such pleasantry as this could hardly have given offence to anyone
into whose skull a jest could penetrate by any operation short
of a surgical one. But it was a very different matter when the
spoken jest passed into a serious expression of opinion in print.
All the theoretic philosophy of which Scotland justly boasts was
hardly sufficient to support with patience such a passage as the
following: “Till the Union made the Scots acquainted with English
manners the culture of their lands was unskilful, and their
domestic life unformed; their tables were coarse as the feasts of
Esquimaux, and their houses filthy as the cottages of Hottentots.”<a name="FNanchor_56_57" id="FNanchor_56_57"></a><a href="#Footnote_56_57" class="fnanchor">[56]</a>
His attacks on the Highlanders would have been read with patience,
if not with pleasure, in Lowland circles. “His account of the
Isles,” wrote Beattie, “is, I dare say, very just. I never was
there.”<a name="FNanchor_57_58" id="FNanchor_57_58"></a><a href="#Footnote_57_58" class="fnanchor">[57]</a> These were not the “asperities” of which that amiable
poet complained. Yet they were asperities which might have provoked
an incensed Highlander to give the author “a crack on his
skull,” had he looked not to the general tenour of the narrative, but
to a few rough passages scattered up and down. M’Nicol would
surely have roused the anger of his countrymen to a fiercer heat had
he forborne to falsify Johnson’s words, and strung together instead
a row of his sarcastic sayings. The offensive passages are not indeed
numerous, but out of such a collection as the following irritation
enough might have been provided: “the genuine improvidence
of savages;”<a name="FNanchor_58_59" id="FNanchor_58_59"></a><a href="#Footnote_58_59" class="fnanchor">[58]</a> “a muddy mixture of pride and ignorance;”<a name="FNanchor_59_60" id="FNanchor_59_60"></a><a href="#Footnote_59_60" class="fnanchor">[59]</a>
“the chiefs gradually degenerating from patriarchal rulers to rapacious<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">{16}</a></span>
landlords;”<a name="FNanchor_60_61" id="FNanchor_60_61"></a><a href="#Footnote_60_61" class="fnanchor">[60]</a> “the animating rabble”<a name="FNanchor_61_62" id="FNanchor_61_62"></a><a href="#Footnote_61_62" class="fnanchor">[61]</a> by which of old a chief
was attended; “the rude speech of a barbarous people;”<a name="FNanchor_62_63" id="FNanchor_62_63"></a><a href="#Footnote_62_63" class="fnanchor">[62]</a> “the
laxity of their conversation, by which the inquirer, by a kind of intellectual
retrogradation, knows less as he hears more;”<a name="FNanchor_63_64" id="FNanchor_63_64"></a><a href="#Footnote_63_64" class="fnanchor">[63]</a> “the
Caledonian bigotry” which helps “an inaccurate auditor” to believe
in the genuineness of Ossian.<a name="FNanchor_64_65" id="FNanchor_64_65"></a><a href="#Footnote_64_65" class="fnanchor">[64]</a></p>

<p>To the sarcasms which had their foundation in Johnson’s dislike
of Presbyterianism Lowlanders and Highlanders were equally exposed.
On Knox and “the ruffians of reformation”<a name="FNanchor_65_66" id="FNanchor_65_66"></a><a href="#Footnote_65_66" class="fnanchor">[65]</a> he has no
mercy. It is true that he maintains that “we read with as little
emotion the violence of Knox and his followers as the irruptions of
Alaric and the Goths.”<a name="FNanchor_66_67" id="FNanchor_66_67"></a><a href="#Footnote_66_67" class="fnanchor">[66]</a> But how deeply he was moved Boswell
shows, where he describes him among the ruins of the once glorious
magnificence of St. Andrews. “I happened to ask where John
Knox was buried. Dr. Johnson burst out, ‘I hope in the high-way.
I have been looking at his reformations.’”<a name="FNanchor_67_68" id="FNanchor_67_68"></a><a href="#Footnote_67_68" class="fnanchor">[67]</a> The sight of the ruined
houses of prayer in Skye drew from him the assertion that “the
malignant influence of Calvinism has blasted ceremony and decency
together.”<a name="FNanchor_68_69" id="FNanchor_68_69"></a><a href="#Footnote_68_69" class="fnanchor">[68]</a> In another passage he describes the ancient “epidemical
enthusiasm compounded of sullen scrupulousness and warlike
ferocity, which, in a people whom idleness resigned to their own
thoughts, was long transmitted in its full strength from the old to
the young.”<a name="FNanchor_69_70" id="FNanchor_69_70"></a><a href="#Footnote_69_70" class="fnanchor">[69]</a> Even for this inveterate ill a cure had at length been
found. “By trade and intercourse with England it is visibly
abating.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE TOUR TO THE WESTERN ISLES.</div>

<p>By the passages in which he described the bareness of the
eastern coast the most irritation was caused. The very hedges
were of stone, and not a tree was to be seen that was not
younger than himself. “A tree might be a show in Scotland as a
horse in Venice.”<a name="FNanchor_70_71" id="FNanchor_70_71"></a><a href="#Footnote_70_71" class="fnanchor">[70]</a> For this he was handled as roughly as Joseph’s
brethren. He was little better than a spy who had come to see
the nakedness of the land. The Scotchmen of that day could not
know, as we know now, that “he treated Scotland no worse than he
did even his best friends, whose characters he used to give as they
appeared to him both in light and shade. ‘He was fond of discrimination,’<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">{17}</a></span>
said Sir Joshua Reynolds, ‘which he could not show
without pointing out the bad as well as the good in every
character.’”<a name="FNanchor_71_72" id="FNanchor_71_72"></a><a href="#Footnote_71_72" class="fnanchor">[71]</a> If in his narrative he has not spared the shade, every
fair-minded reader must allow that he has not been sparing of
the light. John Wesley, who had often travelled over the same
ground as far as Inverness, on May 18, 1776, recorded in his
Journal at Aberdeen: “I read over Dr. Johnson’s <cite>Tour to the
Western Isles</cite>. It is a very curious book, wrote with admirable
sense, and, I think, great fidelity; although in some respects he is
thought to bear hard on the nation, which I am satisfied he never
intended.”<a name="FNanchor_72_73" id="FNanchor_72_73"></a><a href="#Footnote_72_73" class="fnanchor">[72]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHNSON’S COMPLIMENTS TO THE SCOTCH.</div>

<p>That Johnson was not careless of the good opinion of the
Scotch is shown by his eagerness to learn what Boswell had to tell
him about the book. “Let me know as fast as you read it how
you like it; and let me know if any mistake is committed, or anything
important left out.”<a name="FNanchor_73_74" id="FNanchor_73_74"></a><a href="#Footnote_73_74" class="fnanchor">[73]</a> A week later he wrote: “I long to
hear how you like the book; it is, I think, much liked here.” The
modesty of the closing passage of his narrative should have done
something towards disarming criticism. “Having passed my time
almost wholly in cities, I may have been surprised by modes of
life and appearances of nature that are familiar to men of wider
survey and more varied conversation. Novelty and ignorance
must always be reciprocal, and I cannot but be conscious that my
thoughts on national manners are the thoughts of one who has seen
but little.”<a name="FNanchor_74_75" id="FNanchor_74_75"></a><a href="#Footnote_74_75" class="fnanchor">[74]</a> The compliment which he paid to the society of the
capital must surely have won some hearts. “I passed some days
in Edinburgh,” he wrote, “with men of learning whose names
want no advancement from my commemoration, or with women of
elegance, which perhaps disclaims a pedant’s praise.”<a name="FNanchor_75_76" id="FNanchor_75_76"></a><a href="#Footnote_75_76" class="fnanchor">[75]</a> He never
lets slip an opportunity of gracefully acknowledging civilities and
acts of kindness, or of celebrating worth and learning. As he closed
his book, so he had opened it with a well-turned compliment. It
was, he said, Boswell’s “acuteness and gaiety of conversation and
civility of manners which induced him to undertake the journey.”<a name="FNanchor_76_77" id="FNanchor_76_77"></a><a href="#Footnote_76_77" class="fnanchor">[76]</a>
He praises the kindness with which he was gratified by the professors
of St. Andrews, and “the elegance of lettered hospitality”
with which he was entertained.<a name="FNanchor_77_78" id="FNanchor_77_78"></a><a href="#Footnote_77_78" class="fnanchor">[77]</a> At Aberdeen the same grateful heart<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">{18}</a></span>
is seen. Among the professors he found one whom he had known
twenty years earlier in London. “Such unexpected renewals of acquaintance
may be numbered among the most pleasing incidents of
life. The knowledge of one professor soon procured me the notice of
the rest, and I did not want any token of regard.”<a name="FNanchor_78_79" id="FNanchor_78_79"></a><a href="#Footnote_78_79" class="fnanchor">[78]</a> He had the freedom
of the city conferred upon him. In acknowledging the honour he
compliments the town at the expense of England, by mentioning a
circumstance which, he says, “I am afraid I should not have had to
say of any city south of the Tweed; I found no petty officer bowing
for a fee.”<a name="FNanchor_79_80" id="FNanchor_79_80"></a><a href="#Footnote_79_80" class="fnanchor">[79]</a> With Lord Monboddo he was never on friendly
terms. “I knew that they did not love each other,” writes Boswell,
with a studied softness of expression. Yet Johnson in his narrative
praises “the magnetism of his conversation.”<a name="FNanchor_80_81" id="FNanchor_80_81"></a><a href="#Footnote_80_81" class="fnanchor">[80]</a> With Lord Auchinleck
he had that violent altercation which the unfortunate piety of
the son forbade the biographer to exhibit for the entertainment of
the public. Nevertheless, he only mentions his antagonist to compliment
him.<a name="FNanchor_81_82" id="FNanchor_81_82"></a><a href="#Footnote_81_82" class="fnanchor">[81]</a> If he attacked Presbyterianism, yet to the Presbyterian
ministers in the Hebrides he was unsparing of his praise.
He celebrates their learning, which was the more admirable as they
were men “who had no motive to study but generous curiosity or
desire of usefulness.”<a name="FNanchor_82_83" id="FNanchor_82_83"></a><a href="#Footnote_82_83" class="fnanchor">[82]</a> However much he differed from “the learned
Mr. Macqueen” about Ossian, yet he admits that “his knowledge and
politeness give him a title equally to kindness and respect.”<a name="FNanchor_83_84" id="FNanchor_83_84"></a><a href="#Footnote_83_84" class="fnanchor">[83]</a> With<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">{19}</a></span>
the aged minister of Col he had a wrangle over Bayle, and Clarke,
and Leibnitz. “Had he been softer with this venerable old man,”
writes Boswell, “we might have had more conversation.”<a name="FNanchor_84_85" id="FNanchor_84_85"></a><a href="#Footnote_84_85" class="fnanchor">[84]</a> This
rebuke Johnson read in Boswell’s manuscript. The amends which
he makes is surely ample. He describes the minister’s “look of
venerable dignity, excelling what I remember in any other man. I
lost some of his goodwill by treating a heretical writer with more
regard than in his opinion a heretic could deserve. I honoured
his orthodoxy, and did not much censure his asperity. A man
who has settled his opinions does not love to have the tranquillity
of his conviction disturbed; and at seventy-seven it is time to be
in earnest.”<a name="FNanchor_85_86" id="FNanchor_85_86"></a><a href="#Footnote_85_86" class="fnanchor">[85]</a></p>

<p>The people he praises no less than their ministers. “Civility,”
he says, “seems part of the national character of Highlanders.
Every chieftain is a monarch, and politeness, the natural product
of royal government, is diffused from the Laird through the whole
clan.”<a name="FNanchor_86_87" id="FNanchor_86_87"></a><a href="#Footnote_86_87" class="fnanchor">[86]</a> He describes the daughter of the man who kept the hut
in Glenmorison, where he passed a night. “Her conversation
like her appearance was gentle and pleasing. We knew that the
girls of the Highlanders are all gentlewomen, and treated her with
great respect, which she received as customary and due.”<a name="FNanchor_87_88" id="FNanchor_87_88"></a><a href="#Footnote_87_88" class="fnanchor">[87]</a> He
praises the general hospitality. “Wherever there is a house the
stranger finds a welcome. If his good fortune brings him to the
residence of a gentleman he will be glad of a storm to prolong his
stay.”<a name="FNanchor_88_89" id="FNanchor_88_89"></a><a href="#Footnote_88_89" class="fnanchor">[88]</a> How graceful is the compliment which he pays to Macleod
of Rasay! “Rasay has little that can detain a traveller except the
Laird and his family; but their power wants no auxiliaries. Such
a seat of hospitality amidst the winds and waters fills the imagination
with a delightful contrariety of images. Without is the rough
ocean and the rocky land, the beating billows and the howling
storm; within is plenty and elegance, beauty and gaiety, the song
and the dance. In Rasay if I could have found a Ulysses I had
fancied a Phæacia.”<a name="FNanchor_89_90" id="FNanchor_89_90"></a><a href="#Footnote_89_90" class="fnanchor">[89]</a> To the other branch of the Macleods he is
no less complimentary. “At Dunvegan I had tasted lotus,” he wrote,
“and was in danger of forgetting that I was ever to depart.”<a name="FNanchor_90_91" id="FNanchor_90_91"></a><a href="#Footnote_90_91" class="fnanchor">[90]</a> He
met Flora Macdonald, and does not let the occasion pass to pay her
a high compliment. “Hers is a name that will be mentioned in
history, and, if courage and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">{20}</a></span>
honour.”<a name="FNanchor_91_92" id="FNanchor_91_92"></a><a href="#Footnote_91_92" class="fnanchor">[91]</a> In fact, he rarely introduces in his narrative any living
person but in way of compliment or acknowledgment. “He
speaks ill of nobody but Ossian,” said Lord Mansfield, Scotchman
though he was.<a name="FNanchor_92_93" id="FNanchor_92_93"></a><a href="#Footnote_92_93" class="fnanchor">[92]</a> “There has been of late,” he once said, “a
strange turn in travellers to be displeased.”<a name="FNanchor_93_94" id="FNanchor_93_94"></a><a href="#Footnote_93_94" class="fnanchor">[93]</a> There was no such
turn in him. From the beginning to the end of his narrative, there
is not a single grumble. In Mull last summer I had the pleasure
of meeting an old general, a Highlander, who had seen a great
deal of rough service in the East Indies. Someone in the
company let drop an unfavourable remark on Johnson. “I lately
read his <cite>Journey</cite>,” the general replied, “and when I thought of his
age, his weak health, and the rudeness of the accommodation in
those old days, I was astonished at finding that he never complained.”
In his food he had a relish for what was nice and
delicate. Yet he records that “he only twice found any reason to
complain of a Scottish table. He that shall complain of his fare
in the Hebrides has improved his delicacy more than his manhood.”<a name="FNanchor_94_95" id="FNanchor_94_95"></a><a href="#Footnote_94_95" class="fnanchor">[94]</a>
“If an epicure,” he says in another passage, “could remove
by a wish in quest of sensual gratifications, wherever he had
supped he would breakfast in Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_95_96" id="FNanchor_95_96"></a><a href="#Footnote_95_96" class="fnanchor">[95]</a> Boswell, we read, “was
made uneasy and almost fretful” by their bad accommodation
in the miserable inn at Glenelg. “Dr. Johnson was calm. I said
he was so from vanity. <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> ‘No, Sir, it is from philosophy.’”<a name="FNanchor_96_97" id="FNanchor_96_97"></a><a href="#Footnote_96_97" class="fnanchor">[96]</a>
The same philosophy accompanied him not only through
his journey, but through his letters and his narrative. Nearly five
weeks after he had left Edinburgh he wrote to Mrs. Thrale:
“The hill Rattiken and the inn at Glenelg were the only things of
which we or travellers yet more delicate could find any pretensions
to complain.”<a name="FNanchor_97_98" id="FNanchor_97_98"></a><a href="#Footnote_97_98" class="fnanchor">[97]</a> Yet he was by no means free from bodily troubles,
as his letters show. He was “miserably deaf,” he wrote at one time,
and was still suffering from the remains of inflammation in the eye,
he wrote at another time. His nerves seemed to be growing weaker.
The climate, he thought, “perhaps not within his degree of healthy
latitude.”<a name="FNanchor_98_99" id="FNanchor_98_99"></a><a href="#Footnote_98_99" class="fnanchor">[98]</a> The climate, indeed, had been at its worst. In all
September he had only one day and a half of fair weather, and in
October perhaps not more.<a name="FNanchor_99_100" id="FNanchor_99_100"></a><a href="#Footnote_99_100" class="fnanchor">[99]</a> Kept indoors as he was by the rain,
he often suffered under the additional discomfort of bad accommodation.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">{21}</a></span>
Two nights he passed in wretched huts; one in a barn;
two in the miserable cabin of a small trading-ship; one in a room
where the floor was mire. Even in some of the better houses he
had not always a chamber to himself at night, while in the daytime
privacy and quiet were not to be enjoyed. At Corrichatachin,
where he twice made a stay, “we had,” writes Boswell, “no rooms
that we could command; for the good people had no notion that a
man could have any occasion but for a mere sleeping place; so,
during the day, the bed-chambers were common to all the house.
Servants eat in Dr. Johnson’s, and mine was a kind of general
rendezvous of all under the roof, children and dogs not excepted.”<a name="FNanchor_100_101" id="FNanchor_100_101"></a><a href="#Footnote_100_101" class="fnanchor">[100]</a></p>

<p>He not only passes over in silence the weariness and discomforts
of his tour, but he understates the risks which he ran. On
that dark and stormy October night, when the frail vessel in which
he had embarked was driven far out of its course to Col, he was in
great danger. “‘Thank God, we are safe!’ cried the young Laird,
as at last they spied the harbour of Lochiern.”<a name="FNanchor_101_102" id="FNanchor_101_102"></a><a href="#Footnote_101_102" class="fnanchor">[101]</a> This scene of
peril, of which Boswell gives a spirited description, is dismissed by
Johnson in his letter to Mrs. Thrale in a few words: “A violent
gust, which Bos. had a great mind to call a tempest, forced us
into Col, an obscure island.”<a name="FNanchor_102_103" id="FNanchor_102_103"></a><a href="#Footnote_102_103" class="fnanchor">[102]</a> In his narrative, if he makes a little
more of it, he does so, it seems, only for the sake of paying a compliment
to the seamanship of Maclean of Col.<a name="FNanchor_103_104" id="FNanchor_103_104"></a><a href="#Footnote_103_104" class="fnanchor">[103]</a> It was this stormy
night, especially, that was in Sir Walter Scott’s mind when he
described “the whole expedition as being highly perilous, considering
the season of the year, the precarious chance of getting
seaworthy boats, and the ignorance of the Hebrideans, who are
very careless and unskilful sailors.”<a name="FNanchor_104_105" id="FNanchor_104_105"></a><a href="#Footnote_104_105" class="fnanchor">[104]</a></p>

<p>If votive offerings have been made to the God of storms by
those who have escaped the perils of the deep, surely some tall
column might well be raised on the entrance to Lochiern by the
gratitude of the readers of the immortal <cite>Life</cite>. Had the ship been
overwhelmed, not only the hero, but his biographer, would have
perished. One more great man would have been added to the sad
long list of those of whom the poet sang:</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>By the men of Johnson’s time the journey was looked upon as one
of real adventure. When Boswell visited Voltaire at Ferney,
and mentioned their design of taking this tour, “he looked at him
as if he had talked of going to the North Pole, and said, ‘You do
not insist on my accompanying you?’ ‘No, Sir.’ ‘Then I am
very willing you should go.’”<a name="FNanchor_106_107" id="FNanchor_106_107"></a><a href="#Footnote_106_107" class="fnanchor">[106]</a> Dr. Percy, of the <cite>Reliques</cite>, wrote
from Alnwick Castle that a gentleman who had lately returned
from the Hebrides, had told him that the two travellers were
detained prisoners in Skye, their return having been intercepted
by the torrents. “Sir Alexander Macdonald and his lady,” Percy
adds, “at whose house our friend Johnson is a captive, had made
their escape before the floods cut off their retreat; so that possibly
we may not see our friend till next summer releases him.”<a name="FNanchor_107_108" id="FNanchor_107_108"></a><a href="#Footnote_107_108" class="fnanchor">[107]</a> A
Glasgow newspaper gave much the same report, but attributed his
delay to the danger of crossing in the late autumn “such a stormy
surge in a small boat.”<a name="FNanchor_108_109" id="FNanchor_108_109"></a><a href="#Footnote_108_109" class="fnanchor">[108]</a> On the Island of Col they were indeed
storm-bound for eleven days. “On the travellers’ return to
Edinburgh,” writes Boswell, “everybody had accosted us with
some studied compliment. Dr. Johnson said, ‘I am really ashamed
of the congratulations which we receive. We are addressed as if
we had made a voyage to Nova Zembla, and suffered five persecutions
in Japan.’”<a name="FNanchor_109_110" id="FNanchor_109_110"></a><a href="#Footnote_109_110" class="fnanchor">[109]</a> Dr. Robertson “had advanced to him repeating
a line of Virgil, which I forget,” Boswell adds. “I suppose either,</p>

<p>Johnson afterwards remarked that to see a man come up with a
formal air and a Latin line, when we had no fatigue and no danger,
was provoking.” Of exaggeration he had always a strong hatred,
and would not allow it in his own case any more than in another’s.
He had undergone great fatigue, and he had been in real danger,
but of both he made light. <span class="sidenote">JOHNSON’S DELIGHT IN HIS TOUR.</span>It was in high spirits that he returned
home after his tour of a hundred days. “I came home last night,”
he wrote to Boswell, “and am ready to begin a new journey.”<a name="FNanchor_112_113" id="FNanchor_112_113"></a><a href="#Footnote_112_113" class="fnanchor">[112]</a><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">{23}</a></span>
He had fulfilled his long-cherished wish, and no wonder his spirits
were high. His father, the old Lichfield bookseller, had put into
his hands when he was very young Martin’s <cite>Description of the
Western Islands</cite>, and had thus roused his youthful fancy.<a name="FNanchor_113_114" id="FNanchor_113_114"></a><a href="#Footnote_113_114" class="fnanchor">[113]</a> His
longing to visit the wild scenes of which he had read in his childhood
would in all likelihood have remained ungratified, had it not
been for Boswell. He had known that lively young gentleman
but a very few weeks, when, over supper “in a private room at the
Turk’s Head Coffee-house in the Strand,” he promised to accompany
him to the Hebrides.<a name="FNanchor_114_115" id="FNanchor_114_115"></a><a href="#Footnote_114_115" class="fnanchor">[114]</a> Ten years elapsed before the promise
was fulfilled. “I cannot but laugh,” he said at Armidale in Skye,
“to think of myself roving among the Hebrides at sixty.<a name="FNanchor_115_116" id="FNanchor_115_116"></a><a href="#Footnote_115_116" class="fnanchor">[115]</a> I
wonder where I shall rove at four-score.”<a name="FNanchor_116_117" id="FNanchor_116_117"></a><a href="#Footnote_116_117" class="fnanchor">[116]</a> To Mrs. Thrale
soon after his birthday he wrote: “You remember the Doge of
Genoa, who being asked what struck him most at the French
Court, answered, ‘Myself.’ I cannot think many things here more
likely to affect the fancy, than to see Johnson ending his sixty-fourth
year in the wilderness of the Hebrides.”<a name="FNanchor_117_118" id="FNanchor_117_118"></a><a href="#Footnote_117_118" class="fnanchor">[117]</a> “Little did I
once think,” he wrote another day, “of seeing this region of
obscurity, and little did you once expect a salutation from this
verge of European life. I have now the pleasure of going where
nobody goes, and seeing what nobody sees.”<a name="FNanchor_118_119" id="FNanchor_118_119"></a><a href="#Footnote_118_119" class="fnanchor">[118]</a> So close to this
verge did Mrs. Thrale suppose he was, that she thought that he
was in sight of Iceland.<a name="FNanchor_119_120" id="FNanchor_119_120"></a><a href="#Footnote_119_120" class="fnanchor">[119]</a> She and his friends of the Mitre or

seen him that night in Col when “he strutted about the room with
a broad-sword and target,” and that other night when Boswell
“put a large blue bonnet on the top of his bushy grey wig.”<a name="FNanchor_120_121" id="FNanchor_120_121"></a><a href="#Footnote_120_121" class="fnanchor">[120]</a></p>

<p>The motives which led him on his adventurous journey were
not those which every summer and autumn bring travellers in
swarms, not only from England, but from the mainland of Europe,
from across the wide Atlantic, from India, from Southern Africa,
from Australia and New Zealand to these Highlands of poetry and
romance. “I got,” he said, “an acquisition of more ideas by my
tour than by anything that I remember. I saw quite a different
system of life.”<a name="FNanchor_121_122" id="FNanchor_121_122"></a><a href="#Footnote_121_122" class="fnanchor">[121]</a> It was life, not scenery, which he went to study.
On his return to the south of Scotland he was asked “how he
liked the Highlands. The question seemed to irritate him, for he
answered, ‘How, Sir, can you ask me what obliges me to speak
unfavourably of a country where I have been hospitably entertained?
Who <em>can</em> like the Highlands? I like the inhabitants
very well.’”<a name="FNanchor_122_123" id="FNanchor_122_123"></a><a href="#Footnote_122_123" class="fnanchor">[122]</a> The love of wild scenery was in truth only beginning
as his life was drawing to its close. “It is but of late,” wrote
Pennant in 1772, “that the North Britons became sensible of the
beauties of their country; but their search is at present amply
rewarded. Very lately a cataract of uncommon height was discovered
on the Bruar.”<a name="FNanchor_123_124" id="FNanchor_123_124"></a><a href="#Footnote_123_124" class="fnanchor">[123]</a> Fifteen years later Burns, in his <cite>Humble
Petition of Bruar Water</cite>, shows that the discovery had been followed
up:</p>

<div class="verse indent2">And misty mountain grey.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE DISCOVERY OF STAFFA.</div>

<p>But in the year 1773 Johnson could say without much, if indeed
any exaggeration, that “to the southern inhabitants of Scotland
the state of the mountains and the islands is equally unknown
with that of Borneo and Sumatra; of both they have only heard a
little and guess the rest.”<a name="FNanchor_124_125" id="FNanchor_124_125"></a><a href="#Footnote_124_125" class="fnanchor">[124]</a> Staffa had been just discovered by Sir
Joseph Banks. It seems almost passing belief, but yet it is
strictly true, that Staffa&mdash;Staffa, as one of the wonders of creation&mdash;was
unknown till the eve of Johnson’s visit to the Hebrides.
The neighbouring islanders of course had seen it, but had seen it
without curiosity or emotion. They were like the impassive<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">{25}</a></span>
Frenchman who lived in Paris throughout the whole of the Reign
of Terror, and did not notice that anything remarkable went on.
It was on August 12, 1772, a day which should for ever be famous
in the annals of discovery, that Banks coming to anchor in the
Sound of Mull, “was asked ashore” by Mr. Macleane of Drumnen.
At his house he met with one Mr. Leach, an English
gentleman, who told him that at the distance of about nine leagues
lay an island, unvisited even by the Highlanders, with pillars on it
like those of the Giant’s Causeway.<a name="FNanchor_125_126" id="FNanchor_125_126"></a><a href="#Footnote_125_126" class="fnanchor">[125]</a></p>

<p>No yachtsman as yet threaded his way through the almost
countless islets of our western seas; the only sails as yet reflected
on the unruffled surface of the land-locked firths were the fisher’s
and the trader’s. For the sea as yet love was neither felt nor
affected. There was no gladness in its dark-blue waters. Fifteen
years were to pass before Byron was born&mdash;the first of our poets,
it has been said, who sang the delights of sailing. A ship was still
“a jail, with the chance of being drowned.”<a name="FNanchor_126_127" id="FNanchor_126_127"></a><a href="#Footnote_126_127" class="fnanchor">[126]</a> No Southerner went

purer air. It was after Johnson’s tour that an English writer urged
the citizens of Edinburgh to plant trees in the neighbourhood of
their town because “the increase of vegetation would purify the
air, and dispel those putrid and noxious vapours which are
frequently wafted from the Highlands.”<a name="FNanchor_127_128" id="FNanchor_127_128"></a><a href="#Footnote_127_128" class="fnanchor">[127]</a> It was on an early day
of August, in a finer season than had been known for years, that
Wolfe, the hero of Quebec, complained that neither temperance
nor exercise could preserve him in any tolerable health in the unfriendly
climate of Loch Lomond.<a name="FNanchor_128_129" id="FNanchor_128_129"></a><a href="#Footnote_128_129" class="fnanchor">[128]</a> Of all the changes which have
come over our country, perhaps none was more unforeseen than the
growth of this passion for the Highlands and the Hebrides. Could
Johnson have learnt from some one gifted with prophetic power
that there were passages in his narrative which would move the
men of the coming century to scoff, it was not his references to
scenery which would have roused his suspicion. I have heard a
Scotchman laugh uproariously over his description of a mountain
as “a considerable protuberance.” He did not know however
where the passage came, and he admitted that, absurd as it
was, it was not quite so ridiculous when taken with the context.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">{26}</a></span>
“Another mountain,” said Boswell, “I called immense. ‘No,’ replied
Johnson, ‘it is no more than a considerable protuberance.’”<a name="FNanchor_129_130" id="FNanchor_129_130"></a><a href="#Footnote_129_130" class="fnanchor">[129]</a>
It was his hatred of exaggeration and love of accurate language
which provoked the correction&mdash;the same hatred and the same love
which led him at college to check his comrades if they called a
thing “prodigious.”<a name="FNanchor_130_131" id="FNanchor_130_131"></a><a href="#Footnote_130_131" class="fnanchor">[130]</a> But to us, nursed as we have been and our
fathers before us in a romantic school, the language of Johnson and
of his contemporaries about the wild scenes of nature never fails to
rouse our astonishment and our mirth. Were they to come back
to earth, I do not know but that at our extravagancies of admiration
and style, our affectations in the tawdry art of “word-painting,”
and at our preference of barren mountains to the meadow-lands,
and corn-fields, and woods, and orchards, and quiet streams of
southern England, their strong and manly common sense might
not fairly raise a still heartier laugh.</p>

<div class="sidenote">MOUNTAIN SCENERY.</div>

<p>The ordinary reader is apt to attribute to an insensibility to
beauty in Johnson what, to a great extent, was common to most of
the men of his time. It is true that for the beauties of nature,
whether wild or tame, his perception was by no means quick.
Nevertheless, we find his indifference to barren scenery largely
shared in by men of poetic temperament. Even Gray, who looked
with a poet’s eye on the crags and cliffs and torrents by which his
path wound along as he went up to the Grande Chartreuse, yet,
early in September, when the heather would be all in bloom, writes
of crossing in Perthshire “a wide and dismal heath fit for an assembly
of witches.”<a name="FNanchor_131_132" id="FNanchor_131_132"></a><a href="#Footnote_131_132" class="fnanchor">[131]</a> Wherever he wandered he loved to find the
traces of men. It was not desolation, but the earth as the beautiful
home of man that moved him and his fellows. <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Mentem mortalia
tangunt.</i> He found the Apennines not so horrid as the Alps,
because not only the valleys but even the mountains themselves
were many of them cultivated within a little of their very tops.<a name="FNanchor_132_133" id="FNanchor_132_133"></a><a href="#Footnote_132_133" class="fnanchor">[132]</a>
The fifth Earl of Carlisle, a poet though not a Gray, in August,
1768, hurried faster even than the post across the Tyrol from
Verona to Mannheim, “because there was nothing but rest that
was worth stopping one moment for.” The sameness of the
scenery was wearisome to his lordship, “large rocky mountains,
covered with fir-trees; a rapid river in the valley; the road made
like a shelf on the side of the hill.” He rejoiced when he took his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">{27}</a></span>
leave of the Alps, and came upon “fields very well cultivated,
valleys with rich verdure, and little woods which almost persuaded
him he was in England.”<a name="FNanchor_133_134" id="FNanchor_133_134"></a><a href="#Footnote_133_134" class="fnanchor">[133]</a></p>

<p>There is a passage in Camden’s description of Argyleshire in
which we find feelings expressed which for the next two centuries
were very generally entertained. “Along the shore,” he writes,
“the country is more
unpleasant in sight,
what with rocks and
what with blackish
barren mountains.”<a name="FNanchor_134_135" id="FNanchor_134_135"></a><a href="#Footnote_134_135" class="fnanchor">[134]</a>
One hundred and fifty
years after this was
written, an Englishman,
describing in
1740 the beautiful
road which runs along
the south-eastern
shore of Loch Ness,
calls the rugged mountains
“those hideous
productions of nature.”<a name="FNanchor_135_136" id="FNanchor_135_136"></a><a href="#Footnote_135_136" class="fnanchor">[135]</a>
He pictures
to himself the terror
which would come
upon the Southerner
who “should be
brought blindfold into
some narrow rocky
hollow, inclosed with
these horrid prospects,
and there should have his bandage taken off. He would be ready
to die with fear, as thinking it impossible he should ever get out to
return to his native country.”<a name="FNanchor_136_137" id="FNanchor_136_137"></a><a href="#Footnote_136_137" class="fnanchor">[136]</a> This account was very likely read
by Johnson, for it was published in London only nineteen years
before he made his tour. In the narrative of a Volunteer in the
Duke of Cumberland’s army, we find the same gloom cast by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">{28}</a></span>
mountain scenery on the spirits of Englishmen. The soldiers who
were encamped near Loch Ness fell sick daily in their minds as
well as in their bodies from nothing but the sadness produced by
the sight of the black barren mountains covered with snow, with
streams of water rolling down them. To divert their melancholy,
which threatened to develop even into hypochondriacal madness,
races were held. It was with great joy that the volunteer at last
“turned his back upon these hideous mountains and the noisy ding
of the great falls of waters.”<a name="FNanchor_137_138" id="FNanchor_137_138"></a><a href="#Footnote_137_138" class="fnanchor">[137]</a></p>

<p>Even the dales of Cumberland struck strangers with awe.
Six months before Wordsworth was born, Gray wandered up
Borrowdale to the point where now the long train of tourist-laden
coaches day after day in summer turns to the right towards
Honister Pass and Buttermere. “All farther access,” he wrote,
“is here barred to prying mortals, only there is a little path winding
over the Fells, and for some weeks in the year passable to the
Dale’s-men; but the mountains know well that these innocent
people will not reveal the mysteries of their ancient kingdom, the
reign of Chaos and Old Night.”<a name="FNanchor_138_139" id="FNanchor_138_139"></a><a href="#Footnote_138_139" class="fnanchor">[138]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MELANCHOLY HIGHLANDS.</div>

<p>A few days after Johnson had arrived in Scotland, Mason, the
poet, visited Keswick. Many of the woods which had charmed
his friend Gray had been since cut down, and a dry season had
reduced the cascade to scanty rills. “With the frightful and
surprising only,” he wrote, “I cannot be pleased.”<a name="FNanchor_139_140" id="FNanchor_139_140"></a><a href="#Footnote_139_140" class="fnanchor">[139]</a> He and his
companion climbed to the summit of Skiddaw, where, just as if
they were on the top of the Matterhorn, they found that “respiration
seemed to be performed with a kind of asthmatic oppression.”<a name="FNanchor_140_141" id="FNanchor_140_141"></a><a href="#Footnote_140_141" class="fnanchor">[140]</a>
To John Wesley, a traveller such as few men have ever been, wild
scenery was no more pleasing than to the man who wandered for
the first time. Those “horrid mountains” he twice calls the fine
ranges of hills in the North Riding of Yorkshire, whose waters
feed the Swale and the Tees, though it was in summer-time that
he was travelling.<a name="FNanchor_141_142" id="FNanchor_141_142"></a><a href="#Footnote_141_142" class="fnanchor">[141]</a> To Pennant Glencroe was “the seat of melancholy.”<a name="FNanchor_142_143" id="FNanchor_142_143"></a><a href="#Footnote_142_143" class="fnanchor">[142]</a>
Beattie, Burns’s “sweet harmonious Beattie,” finds the
same sadness in the mountains:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Highlands of Scotland” (he writes) “are a picturesque, but in general a
melancholy country. Long tracts of mountainous desert, covered with dark heath,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">{29}</a></span>
and often obscured by misty weather; narrow valleys, thinly inhabited and bounded
by precipices resounding with the fall of torrents; a soil so rugged, and a climate so
dreary, as in many parts to admit neither the amusements of pasturage nor the
labours of agriculture; the mournful dashing of waves along the friths and lakes
that intersect the country; the portentous noises which every change of the wind,
and every increase and diminution of the waters, is apt to raise in a lonely region
full of echoes, and rocks, and caverns; the grotesque and ghastly appearance of
such a landscape by the light of the moon&mdash;objects like these diffuse a gloom over
the fancy which may be compatible enough with occasional and social merriment,
but cannot fail to tincture the thoughts of a native in the hour of silence and
solitude.”<a name="FNanchor_143_144" id="FNanchor_143_144"></a><a href="#Footnote_143_144" class="fnanchor">[143]</a></p></div>

<p>The French writer, Faujas de Saint Fond, who visited the
Highlands about the year 1780, was touched with the same unromantic
gloom. When on his way from the barren mountains of
the north he reached the fertile southern shore of Loch Tay, and
caught the first glimpse of the change to happier climes, his soul
experienced as sweet a joy as is given by the first breath of spring.
He had escaped from a land where winter seemed eternally to reign,
where all was wild, and barren, and sad.<a name="FNanchor_144_145" id="FNanchor_144_145"></a><a href="#Footnote_144_145" class="fnanchor">[144]</a> Even Macleod of Macleod,
the proprietor of nine inhabited isles and of islands uninhabited
almost beyond number, who held four times as much land as

him,<a name="FNanchor_145_146" id="FNanchor_145_146"></a><a href="#Footnote_145_146" class="fnanchor">[145]</a> looked upon life in his castle at Dunvegan as “confinement in

“dreary regions.”<a name="FNanchor_146_147" id="FNanchor_146_147"></a><a href="#Footnote_146_147" class="fnanchor">[146]</a> Slight, then, must have been the shock which

want of “variety in universal barrenness.”<a name="FNanchor_155_156" id="FNanchor_155_156"></a><a href="#Footnote_155_156" class="fnanchor">[155]</a> In the midst of such
scenes, as the autumn day was darkening to its close, they would
have allowed that, “when there is a guide whose conduct may be
trusted, a mind not naturally too much disposed to fear, may preserve
some degree of cheerfulness; but what,” they would have
asked, “must be the solicitude of him who should be wandering
among the crags and hollows benighted, ignorant, and alone?”<a name="FNanchor_156_157" id="FNanchor_156_157"></a><a href="#Footnote_156_157" class="fnanchor">[156]</a>
Upon the islets on Loch Lomond they would have longed “to
employ all the arts of embellishment,” so that these little spots
should no longer “court the gazer at a distance, but disgust him at
his approach, when he finds instead of soft lawns and shady thickets
nothing more than uncultivated ruggedness.”<a name="FNanchor_157_158" id="FNanchor_157_158"></a><a href="#Footnote_157_158" class="fnanchor">[157]</a> Everywhere they
would have regretted the want of the arts and civilization and
refinements of modern life.</p>

<div class="sidenote">INDIFFERENCE TO SCENERY.</div>

<p>Had Johnson been treated more kindly by the weather, doubtless
the gloom of the landscape would have been less reflected upon
his pages. Fifty-eight days of rain to three days of clear skies
would have been sufficient to depress even the wildest worshipper
of rude nature. In the eleven days in which he was kept prisoner
by storms in Col, he had “no succession of sunshine to rain, or of
calms to tempests; wind and rain were the only weather.”<a name="FNanchor_158_159" id="FNanchor_158_159"></a><a href="#Footnote_158_159" class="fnanchor">[158]</a> When
the sun did shine he lets us catch a little of its cheerful light. His
first day’s Highland journey took him along the shore of Loch
Ness in weather that was bright, though not hot. “The way was
very pleasant; on the left were high and steep rocks, shaded with
birch, and covered with fern or heath. On the right the limpid
waters of Loch Ness were beating their bank, and waving their
surface by a gentle undulation.”<a name="FNanchor_159_160" id="FNanchor_159_160"></a><a href="#Footnote_159_160" class="fnanchor">[159]</a> The morrow was equally fine.
How prettily he has described his rest in the valley on the bank,
where he first thought of writing the story of his tour, “with a clear
rivulet streaming at his feet. The day was calm, the air was soft,
and all was rudeness, silence and solitude.”<a name="FNanchor_160_161" id="FNanchor_160_161"></a><a href="#Footnote_160_161" class="fnanchor">[160]</a> Very different would
have been the tale which he told had he travelled in the days of fast
and commodious steamboats, good roads and carriages, comfortable
inns, post-offices, telegraphs, and shops. He would not have seen
a different system of life, or got an acquisition of ideas, but he
might have found patience, and even promptings for descriptions of
the beauties of rugged nature. “In an age when every London<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">{31}</a></span>
citizen makes Loch Lomond his wash-pot, and throws his shoe
over Ben Nevis,”<a name="FNanchor_161_162" id="FNanchor_161_162"></a><a href="#Footnote_161_162" class="fnanchor">[161]</a> the old man may easily be mocked, for his indifference
to scenery. But the elderly traveller of our times, who
whirled along “in a well-appointed four-horse coach,” indicates the
beauties of nature to his companions, and utters exclamations of
delight, as from time to time he takes his cigar from his lips, might
have felt as little enthusiasm as Johnson, had he had, like him, to
cross Skye and Mull on horseback, by paths so narrow that each
rider had to go singly, and so craggy that constant care was
required.</p>

<div class="sidenote">POVERTY OF LANDSCAPE.</div>

<p>In Scotland man was nourished to the most stubborn strength of
character, but beauty was the growth that dwindled. In the hard
struggle for bare living, and in the gloom of a religion which gave
strength but crushed loveliness, no man thought of adorning his
home as if it had been his bride. Wordsworth compared the
manses in Scotland with the parsonages, even the poor parsonages
in England, and said that neither they nor their gardens and
grounds had the same “attractive appearance.”<a name="FNanchor_165_166" id="FNanchor_165_166"></a><a href="#Footnote_165_166" class="fnanchor">[165]</a> The English
country-house, with its lawns, its gardens, and its groves, which
adds such a singular charm to our landscape, had not its counterpart
on the other side of the border. Elderly men could
still recall the day when the approach to the laird’s dwelling led
past the stable and the cow-house, when the dunghill was heaped
up close to the hall-door, and when, instead of lawns and beds of
flowers, all around grew a plentiful crop of nettles, docks, and hemlocks.<a name="FNanchor_166_167" id="FNanchor_166_167"></a><a href="#Footnote_166_167" class="fnanchor">[166]</a>
Some improvement had been already made. A taste had
happily begun for “neat houses and ornamental fields,” and to the
hopeful patriot there was “the pleasing prospect that Scotland might
in a century or sooner compare with England, not indeed in magnificence
of country-seats, but in sweetness and variety of concordant
parts.”<a name="FNanchor_167_168" id="FNanchor_167_168"></a><a href="#Footnote_167_168" class="fnanchor">[167]</a> Even at that time it supplied England with its best
gardeners,<a name="FNanchor_168_169" id="FNanchor_168_169"></a><a href="#Footnote_168_169" class="fnanchor">[168]</a> and nevertheless it was a country singularly bare of
gardens. “Pray, now, are you ever able to bring the <em>sloe</em> to perfection?”
asked Johnson of Boswell.<a name="FNanchor_169_170" id="FNanchor_169_170"></a><a href="#Footnote_169_170" class="fnanchor">[169]</a> So far was nature from
being adorned that she had been everywhere stripped naked.
Woods had been cut down, not even had groups of trees been
spared, no solitary oak or elm with its grateful shade stood in the
middle of the field or in the hedge-row; hedge-rows there were
none. The pleasantness of the prospect had been everywhere sacrificed
to the productiveness of the field. The beautiful English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">{33}</a></span>
landscape was gone. “The striking characteristic in the views of
Scotland,” said an observant traveller, “is a poverty of landscape
from a want of objects, particularly of wood. Park scenery is little
known. The lawn, the clump, and the winding walk are rarely
found.”<a name="FNanchor_170_171" id="FNanchor_170_171"></a><a href="#Footnote_170_171" class="fnanchor">[170]</a> As he crossed the border he might have said with Johnson:
“It is only seeing a worse England. It is seeing the flower
gradually fade away to the naked stalk.”<a name="FNanchor_171_172" id="FNanchor_171_172"></a><a href="#Footnote_171_172" class="fnanchor">[171]</a> “Every part of the
country,” wrote Goldsmith from Edinburgh in his student days, “presents
the same dismal landscape. No grove nor brook lend their
music to cheer the stranger, or make the inhabitants forget their
poverty.”<a name="FNanchor_172_173" id="FNanchor_172_173"></a><a href="#Footnote_172_173" class="fnanchor">[172]</a> There was none of “the bloomy flush of life.” The
whole country was open, and resembled one vast common with a few
scattered improvements.<a name="FNanchor_173_174" id="FNanchor_173_174"></a><a href="#Footnote_173_174" class="fnanchor">[173]</a> Along the western road from Longworth
to Dumfries it exhibited “a picture of dreary solitude, of smoky
hovels, naked, ill-cultivated fields, lean cattle and a dejected people,
without manufactures, trade or shipping.”<a name="FNanchor_174_175" id="FNanchor_174_175"></a><a href="#Footnote_174_175" class="fnanchor">[174]</a></p>

<p>The eastern coast, along which Johnson travelled, was singularly
bare of trees. He had not, he said, passed five on the road
fit for the carpenter.<a name="FNanchor_175_176" id="FNanchor_175_176"></a><a href="#Footnote_175_176" class="fnanchor">[175]</a> The first forest trees of full growth which he
saw were in the north of Aberdeenshire.<a name="FNanchor_176_177" id="FNanchor_176_177"></a><a href="#Footnote_176_177" class="fnanchor">[176]</a> “This is a day of novelties,”
he said on the morrow. “I have seen old trees in Scotland,
and I have heard the English clergy treated with disrespect.”<a name="FNanchor_177_178" id="FNanchor_177_178"></a><a href="#Footnote_177_178" class="fnanchor">[177]</a>

<p>There were, of course, noble trees scattered throughout the country.
Gray describes “the four chestnuts of vast bulk and height in Lord<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">{34}</a></span>
Breadalbane’s park,”<a name="FNanchor_180_181" id="FNanchor_180_181"></a><a href="#Footnote_180_181" class="fnanchor">[180]</a> and Pennant, “the venerable oaks, the vast

solemnity to the scene at Finlarig Castle.”<a name="FNanchor_181_182" id="FNanchor_181_182"></a><a href="#Footnote_181_182" class="fnanchor">[181]</a> A love of planting,
which began about the time of the Union, was gradually extending.
Defoe noticed the young groves round the gentlemen’s houses in
the Lothians, and foretold, that in a few years Scotland would not
need to send to Norway for timber and deal.<a name="FNanchor_182_183" id="FNanchor_182_183"></a><a href="#Footnote_182_183" class="fnanchor">[182]</a> The reviewer of
Pennant’s <cite>Tour</cite> in the <cite>Scots Magazine</cite> for January, 1772, rejoiced
to find that the spirit of planting was so generally diffused, and
looked forward to the advantages arising from it, which would be
enjoyed by posterity.<a name="FNanchor_183_184" id="FNanchor_183_184"></a><a href="#Footnote_183_184" class="fnanchor">[183]</a> Sir Walter Scott defended Johnson against
the abuse which had unjustly been cast on him. The east coast, if
the young plantations were excepted, was as destitute of wood as
he had described it.<a name="FNanchor_184_185" id="FNanchor_184_185"></a><a href="#Footnote_184_185" class="fnanchor">[184]</a> Nay, to his sarcasms he greatly ascribed that
love of planting which had almost become a passion.<a name="FNanchor_185_186" id="FNanchor_185_186"></a><a href="#Footnote_185_186" class="fnanchor">[185]</a> It was not
for nothing, then, that Johnson had joked over the loss of his walking-stick
in Mull, and had refused to believe that any man in that
island who had got it would part with it. “Consider, Sir, the value
of such a piece of timber there.”<a name="FNanchor_186_187" id="FNanchor_186_187"></a><a href="#Footnote_186_187" class="fnanchor">[186]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">BACKWARDNESS OF FARMING.</div>

<p>The modern traveller who, as he passes through the Lothians
or Aberdeenshire, looks with admiration on farming in its perfection,
would learn with astonishment how backward Scotch agriculture
was little more than one hundred years ago. While in England
men of high rank and strong minds were ambitious of shining
in the characters of farmers, in Scotland it was looked upon as a
pursuit far beneath the attention of a gentleman. Neither by the
learned had it been made a study.<a name="FNanchor_187_188" id="FNanchor_187_188"></a><a href="#Footnote_187_188" class="fnanchor">[187]</a> There were those who attributed
this general backwardness to the soil and climate; but it was
due, said Lord Kames, “to the indolence of the landholders, the
obstinate indocility of the peasantry, and the stupid attachment
of both classes to ancient habits and practices.”<a name="FNanchor_188_189" id="FNanchor_188_189"></a><a href="#Footnote_188_189" class="fnanchor">[188]</a> The liberal intercourse
between the two countries, which was an unexpected result
of the Rebellion of 1745, greatly quickened the rate of improvement.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before that time the people of Northumberland and the Merse, who spoke
dialects of the same language, and were only separated by a river, had little more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">{35}</a></span>
intercourse than those of Kent and Normandy. After the Rebellion a number of
noblemen and gentlemen amused themselves with farming in the English style.
The late Lord Eglinton spared no expense in getting English servants. He showed
his countrymen what might be done by high cultivation. Mr. Drummond, of Blair,
sent over one of his ploughmen to learn drill husbandry, and the culture of turnips
from Lord Eglinton’s English servants. The very next year he raised a field of
turnips, which were the first in the country. And they were as neatly dressed as any
in Hertfordshire. A single horse ploughing the drills astonished the country people,
who, till then, had never seen fewer than four yoked. About the year 1771 our
tenants were well-disposed to the culture of turnips. They begin to have an idea of
property in winter as well as in summer; nor is it any longer thought bad neighbourhood
to drive off cattle that are trespassing upon their winter crops.”<a name="FNanchor_189_190" id="FNanchor_189_190"></a><a href="#Footnote_189_190" class="fnanchor">[189]</a></p></div>

<p>The young Laird of Col, just before Johnson’s visit, had gone
to Hertfordshire to study farming, and had brought back “the culture
of turnips. His intention is to provide food for his cattle in
the winter. This innovation was considered by Mr. Macsweyn as
the idle project of a young head heated with English fancies; but
he has now found that turnips will grow, and that hungry sheep and
cows will really eat them.”<a name="FNanchor_190_191" id="FNanchor_190_191"></a><a href="#Footnote_190_191" class="fnanchor">[190]</a> Yet progress was not so rapid but
that Adam Smith held that a better system could only be introduced
“by a long course of frugality and industry; half a century
or a century more perhaps must pass away before the old system
which is wearing out gradually can be completely abolished.”<a name="FNanchor_191_192" id="FNanchor_191_192"></a><a href="#Footnote_191_192" class="fnanchor">[191]</a></p>

<p>The cultivation of vegetables for the table and of fruits was also
taking a start, though much remained to be done. When Johnson
was informed at Aberdeen that Cromwell’s soldiers had taught the
Scotch to raise cabbages, he remarked, that “in the passage through
villages it seems to him that surveys their gardens, that when they
had not cabbage they had nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_192_193" id="FNanchor_192_193"></a><a href="#Footnote_192_193" class="fnanchor">[192]</a> Pennant, however, the year
before, in riding from Arbroath to Montrose, had passed by “extensive
fields of potatoes&mdash;a novelty till within the last twenty years.”<a name="FNanchor_193_194" id="FNanchor_193_194"></a><a href="#Footnote_193_194" class="fnanchor">[193]</a>
It was not till Johnson had travelled beyond Elgin that he saw
houses with fruit trees about them. “The improvements of the
Scotch,” he remarks, “are for immediate profit; they do not yet
think it quite worth their while to plant what will not produce something
to be eaten or sold in a very little time.”<a name="FNanchor_194_195" id="FNanchor_194_195"></a><a href="#Footnote_194_195" class="fnanchor">[194]</a> The Scotch historian
of Edinburgh complained that “the apples which were
brought to market from the neighbourhood were unfit for the table.”<a name="FNanchor_195_196" id="FNanchor_195_196"></a><a href="#Footnote_195_196" class="fnanchor">[195]</a>
“Good apples are not to be seen,” wrote Topham in his <cite>Letters<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">{36}</a></span>
from Edinburgh</cite>. “It was,” he said, “owing to the little variety of
fruit that the inhabitants set anything on their tables after dinner
that has the appearance of it, and I have often observed at the
houses of principal people a plate of small turnips introduced in the
dessert, and eaten with avidity.”<a name="FNanchor_196_197" id="FNanchor_196_197"></a><a href="#Footnote_196_197" class="fnanchor">[196]</a> Smollett indirectly alludes to
this reflection on his native country when, in his <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>,
he says that “turnips make their appearance, not as dessert, but by
way of <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">hors d’&#339;uvres</i>, or whets.”<a name="FNanchor_197_198" id="FNanchor_197_198"></a><a href="#Footnote_197_198" class="fnanchor">[197]</a> Even in the present day, the
English traveller far too often looks in vain for the orchards and
the fruit tree with its branches trained over the house-wall. Yet
great progress has been made. In Morayshire, in the present day,
peaches and apricots are seen ripening on the garden walls. In the
year 1852 an Elgin gardener carried off the first prize of the London
Horticultural Society for ten varieties of the finest new dessert
pears.<a name="FNanchor_198_199" id="FNanchor_198_199"></a><a href="#Footnote_198_199" class="fnanchor">[198]</a> If Scotland can do such great things as this, surely justification
is found for the reproaches cast by Johnson on Scottish
ignorance and negligence.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH IGNORANCE OF SCOTLAND.</div>

<p>So closely have the two countries in late years been drawn
together by the wonderful facilities of intercourse afforded by
modern inventions, that it is scarcely possible for us to understand
the feelings of our adventurous forefathers as they crossed the
Borders. At the first step they seemed to be in a foreign country.
“The first town we come to,” wrote Defoe, “is as perfectly Scots
as if you were one hundred miles north of Edinburgh; nor is there
the least appearance of anything English either in customs, habits,
usages of the people, or in their way of living, eating, dress, or
behaviour.”<a name="FNanchor_199_200" id="FNanchor_199_200"></a><a href="#Footnote_199_200" class="fnanchor">[199]</a> “The English,” Smollett complained, “knew as
little of Scotland as of Japan.”<a name="FNanchor_200_201" id="FNanchor_200_201"></a><a href="#Footnote_200_201" class="fnanchor">[200]</a> There is no reason to think that
he was guilty of extravagance, when in his <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite> he
makes Miss Tabitha Bramble, the sister of the Gloucestershire
squire, imagine that “she could not go to Scotland but by sea.”<a name="FNanchor_201_202" id="FNanchor_201_202"></a><a href="#Footnote_201_202" class="fnanchor">[201]</a>
It is amazing to how late a day ignorance almost as gross as this
came down. It was in the year in which George II. came to the
throne that Defoe, in his preface to his <cite>Tour through Great Britain</cite>
wrote:&mdash;“Scotland has been supposed by some to be so contemptible
a place as that it would not bear a description.”<a name="FNanchor_202_203" id="FNanchor_202_203"></a><a href="#Footnote_202_203" class="fnanchor">[202]</a> Eleven years<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_37" id="Page_37">{37}</a></span>
later, in 1738, we find it described much as if it were some lately
discovered island in the South Seas.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The people in general,” we read, “are naturally inclined to civility, especially
to strangers. They are divided into Highlanders who call themselves the antient
Scots, and into Lowlanders who are a mixture of antient Scots, Picts, Britons, French,
English, Danes, Germans, Hungarians, and others. Buchanan describes the
customs of the Highlanders graphically thus:&mdash;‘In their diet, apparel, and household
furniture they follow the parsimony of the antients; they provide their diet by fishing
and hunting, and boil their flesh in the paunch or skin of a beast; while they hunt
they eat it raw, after having squeezed out the blood.’... The Western Islands
(the author goes on to add) lie in the Deucaledonian Sea.... The natives of Mull
when the season is moist take a large dose of aqua-vitæ for a corrective, and chew a
piece of charmel root when they intend to be merry to prevent drunkenness. The
natives of Skye have a peculiar way of curing the distempers they are incident to by
simples of their own product, in which they are successful to a miracle.”<a name="FNanchor_203_204" id="FNanchor_203_204"></a><a href="#Footnote_203_204" class="fnanchor">[203]</a></p></div>

<p>Into so strange and wild a country it required a stout heart to
enter. A volunteer with the English army at the time of the
Rebellion of 1745 wrote from Berwick:&mdash;“Now we are going into
Scotland, but with heavy hearts. They tell us here what terrible
living we shall have there, which I soon after found too true.”<a name="FNanchor_204_205" id="FNanchor_204_205"></a><a href="#Footnote_204_205" class="fnanchor">[204]</a>
How few were the Englishmen who crossed the Tweed even so
late as 1772 is shown by the hope expressed in the <cite>Scots Magazine</cite>
for that year, that the publication of Pennant’s <cite>Tour</cite> would excite
others to follow in his steps.<a name="FNanchor_205_206" id="FNanchor_205_206"></a><a href="#Footnote_205_206" class="fnanchor">[205]</a> Two years later Topham wrote
from Edinburgh that “the common people were astonished to find
himself and his companion become stationary in their town for a
whole winter.... ‘What were we come for?’ was the first question.
‘They presumed to study physic.’ ‘No.’ ‘To study law?’ ‘No.’
‘Then it must be divinity.’ ‘No.’ ‘Very odd,’ they said, ‘that
we should come to Edinburgh without one of these reasons.’”<a name="FNanchor_206_207" id="FNanchor_206_207"></a><a href="#Footnote_206_207" class="fnanchor">[206]</a>
How ignorant the English were of Scotland is shown by the
publication of <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>. The ordinary reader, as he
laughs over the pages of this most humorous of stories, never
suspects that the author in writing it had any political object in
view. Yet there is not a little truth in Horace Walpole’s bitter
assertion that it is “a party novel, written by the profligate hireling
Smollett, to vindicate the Scots, and cry down juries.”<a name="FNanchor_207_208" id="FNanchor_207_208"></a><a href="#Footnote_207_208" class="fnanchor">[207]</a> It was
not so much a party as a patriotic novel. Lord Bute’s brief tenure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">{38}</a></span>
of ignoble office as Prime Minister and King’s Friend, the mischief
which he had done to the whole country, and the favour which he
had shown to his North Britons, a few years earlier had raised a
storm against the Scotch which had not yet subsided. “All the
windows of all the inns northwards,” wrote Smollett, “are scrawled
with doggrel rhymes in abuse of the Scotch nation.”<a name="FNanchor_208_209" id="FNanchor_208_209"></a><a href="#Footnote_208_209" class="fnanchor">[208]</a> With great art
he takes that fine old humorist, Matthew Bramble, from his squire’s
house in Gloucestershire on a tour to the southern part of Scotland,
and makes him and his family send to their various correspondents
lively and pleasant descriptions of all that they saw. At the very
time that he was writing his <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite> a child was born in
one of the narrow Wynds of Edinburgh who was to take up the
work which he had begun, and as the mighty Wizard of the North,
as if by an enchanter’s wand, to lift up the mist which had long
hung over the land which he loved so well, and to throw over
Highlands and Lowlands alike the beauty of romance and the
kindliness of feeling which springs from the associations given by
poetry and fiction.</p>

<p>While the English as yet knew little of Scotland, the Scotch
were not equally ignorant of England. From the days of the
Union they had pressed southwards in the pursuit of wealth, of
fame, and of position. Their migration was such that it afforded
some foundation for Johnson’s saying that “the noblest prospect
which a Scotchman ever sees is the high road that leads him to
England.”<a name="FNanchor_209_210" id="FNanchor_209_210"></a><a href="#Footnote_209_210" class="fnanchor">[209]</a> England was swiftly moving along the road to
Empire, sometimes with silent foot, sometimes with the tramp of
war. In America and in the East Indies her boundaries were
year by year pushed farther and farther on. Her agriculture, her
manufactures, her trade and her commerce were advancing by
leaps and bounds. There was a great stir of life and energy. Into
such a world the young Scotchmen entered with no slight advantages.
In their common schools everywhere an education was
given such as in England was only to be had in a few highly
favoured spots. In their universities even the neediest scholar had
a share. The hard fare, the coarse clothing, and the poor lodgings
with which their students were contented, could be provided by the
labours of the vacation. In their homes they had been trained in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">{39}</a></span>
habits of thrift. They entered upon the widely extending battle
of life like highly trained soldiers, and they gained additional force
by acting together. If they came up “in droves,” it was not one
another that they butted. They exhibited when in a strange land
that “national combination” which Johnson found “so invidious,”
but which brought them to “employment, riches, and distinction.”<a name="FNanchor_210_211" id="FNanchor_210_211"></a><a href="#Footnote_210_211" class="fnanchor">[210]</a>
Their thrift, and an eagerness to push on which sometimes amounted
to servility, provoked many a gibe; but if ever they found time
and inclination to turn from Johnny Home to Shakespeare they
might have replied in the words of Ferdinand:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent6">“Some kinds of baseness</div>
<div class="verse">Are nobly undergone, and most poor matters</div>
<div class="verse">Point to rich ends.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">ADVANTAGES OF THE UNION.</div>

<p>On the advantages of the Union to Scotland Johnson was not
easily tired of haranguing. Of the advantages to England he said
nothing probably because he saw nothing. Yet it would not be
easy to tell on which side the balance lay. Before the Union, he
maintained, “the Scotch had hardly any trade, any money, or any
elegance.”<a name="FNanchor_211_212" id="FNanchor_211_212"></a><a href="#Footnote_211_212" class="fnanchor">[211]</a> In his <cite>Journey to the Western Islands</cite> he tells the
Scotch that “they must be for ever content to owe to the English
that elegance and culture which, if they had been vigilant and
active, perhaps the English might have owed to them.”<a name="FNanchor_212_213" id="FNanchor_212_213"></a><a href="#Footnote_212_213" class="fnanchor">[212]</a></p>

<p>Smollett, who in national prejudice did not yield even to him, has
strongly upheld the opposite opinion. In his <cite>History</cite> he describes
Lord Belhaven’s speech against the Union in the last parliament
which sat in Scotland&mdash;a speech “so pathetic that it drew tears
from the audience. It is,” he adds, “at this day looked upon as a
prophecy by great part of the Scottish nation.”<a name="FNanchor_213_214" id="FNanchor_213_214"></a><a href="#Footnote_213_214" class="fnanchor">[213]</a> The towns on
the Firth of Forth, he maintained, through the loss of the trade
with France, had been falling to decay ever since the two countries
were united.<a name="FNanchor_214_215" id="FNanchor_214_215"></a><a href="#Footnote_214_215" class="fnanchor">[214]</a> In these views he was not supported by the two
great writers who were his countrymen and his contemporaries.
It was chiefly to the Union that Adam Smith attributed the great
improvements in agriculture which had been made in the eighteenth
century.<a name="FNanchor_215_216" id="FNanchor_215_216"></a><a href="#Footnote_215_216" class="fnanchor">[215]</a> It was to the Union that Hume attributed the blessing
“of a government perfectly regular, and exempt from all violence
and injustice.”<a name="FNanchor_216_217" id="FNanchor_216_217"></a><a href="#Footnote_216_217" class="fnanchor">[216]</a> Many years later Thomas Carlyle, in whom<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_40" id="Page_40">{40}</a></span>
glowed the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">perfervidum ingenium Scotorum</i> as it has glowed in
few, owned that “the Union was one of Scotland’s chief blessings,”
though it was due to Wallace and to men like him “that it was
not the chief curse.”<a name="FNanchor_217_218" id="FNanchor_217_218"></a><a href="#Footnote_217_218" class="fnanchor">[217]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A DISPUTATIOUS PEASANTRY.</div>

<p>It must never be forgotten that in this Union England was no
less blessed than Scotland; that if she gave wealth to Scotland,
Scotland nobly repaid the gift in men. In the sixteenth and
seventeenth centuries the English stock had been quickened and
strengthened and ennobled by fugitives seeking refuge on her
shores from the persecutions of priests and kings, which passed
over the coward and the base, and fell only on the brave and the
upright. To the Fleming and the Huguenot was now added the
Scot. In philosophy, in history, in law, in science, in poetry, in
romance, in the arts of life, in trade, in government, in war, in
the spread of our dominions, in the consolidation of our Empire,
glorious has been the part which Scotland has played. Her poet’s
prayer has been answered, and in “bright succession” have been
raised men to adorn and guard not only herself but the country
which belongs to Englishmen and Scotchmen alike. Little of this
was seen, still less foreseen by Johnson. The change which was
going on in Scotland was rapid and conspicuous; the change which
she was working outside her borders was slow, and as yet almost
imperceptible. What was seen raised not admiration, but jealousy
of the vigorous race which was everywhere so rapidly “making its
way to employment, riches, and distinction.” That Johnson should
exult in the good which Scotland had derived from England through
the Union was natural. Scarcely less natural that he should point
out how much remained to be done before the Scotch attained
the English level, not only in the comforts and refinements, but
even in the decencies of life. One great peculiarity in their civilization
struck him deeply. “They had attained the liberal without
the manual arts, and excelled in ornamental knowledge while they
wanted the conveniences of common life.”<a name="FNanchor_218_219" id="FNanchor_218_219"></a><a href="#Footnote_218_219" class="fnanchor">[218]</a> Even the peasantry
were able to dispute with wonderful sagacity upon the articles of
their faith, though they were content to live in huts which had not
a single chimney to carry off the smoke.<a name="FNanchor_219_220" id="FNanchor_219_220"></a><a href="#Footnote_219_220" class="fnanchor">[219]</a> Wesley, each time that
he crossed the Borders, found a far harder task awaiting him than
when he was upbraiding, denouncing, and exhorting an English<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_41" id="Page_41">{41}</a></span>
congregation. To the Scotch, cradled as they had been in the
Shorter Catechism, and trained as they were from their youth up
in theology, his preaching, like Paul’s to the Greeks, was too often
foolishness. He spoke to a people, as he complained, “who heard
much, knew everything, and felt nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_220_221" id="FNanchor_220_221"></a><a href="#Footnote_220_221" class="fnanchor">[220]</a> Though “you use
the most cutting words still they <em>hear</em>, but <em>feel</em> no more than the
seats they sit upon.”<a name="FNanchor_221_222" id="FNanchor_221_222"></a><a href="#Footnote_221_222" class="fnanchor">[221]</a> Nowhere did he speak more roughly than
in Scotland. No one there was offended at plain dealing. “In
this respect they were a pattern to all mankind.” But yet “they
hear and hear, and are just what they were before.”<a name="FNanchor_222_223" id="FNanchor_222_223"></a><a href="#Footnote_222_223" class="fnanchor">[222]</a> He was
fresh from the Kelso people and was preaching to a meeting in
Northumberland when he wrote: “Oh! what a difference is there
between these living stones, and the dead unfeeling multitudes in
Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_223_224" id="FNanchor_223_224"></a><a href="#Footnote_223_224" class="fnanchor">[223]</a> “The misfortune of a Scotch congregation,” he recorded
on another occasion, “is they know everything; so they
learn nothing.”<a name="FNanchor_224_225" id="FNanchor_224_225"></a><a href="#Footnote_224_225" class="fnanchor">[224]</a></p>

<p>With their disputatious learning the meagreness of their fare and
the squalor of their dwellings but ill contrasted. “Dirty living,”
said Smollett, “is the great and general reproach of the commonalty
of this kingdom.”<a name="FNanchor_225_226" id="FNanchor_225_226"></a><a href="#Footnote_225_226" class="fnanchor">[225]</a> While Scotland sent forth into the world year
after year swarms of young men trained in thrift, well stored with
knowledge, and full of energy and determination, the common people
bore an ill-repute for industry. They were underfed, and under-feeding
produced indolent work. “Flesh-meat they seldom or never
tasted; nor any kind of strong liquor except two-penny at times of

part of the maintenance of those in Scotland who live by the sweat
of their brow. Water is their only drink.”<a name="FNanchor_227_228" id="FNanchor_227_228"></a><a href="#Footnote_227_228" class="fnanchor">[227]</a> Adam Smith admitted
that both in bodily strength and personal appearance they
were below the English standard. “They neither work so well,
nor look so well.”<a name="FNanchor_228_229" id="FNanchor_228_229"></a><a href="#Footnote_228_229" class="fnanchor">[228]</a> Wolfe, when he returned to England from
Scotland in 1753, said that he had not crossed the Border a
mile when he saw the difference that was produced upon the
face of the country by labour and industry. “The English are
clean and laborious, and the Scotch excessively dirty and lazy.”<a name="FNanchor_229_230" id="FNanchor_229_230"></a><a href="#Footnote_229_230" class="fnanchor">[229]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">POVERTY OF THE COMMON PEOPLE.</div>

<p>This dirtiness would offend an Englishman more than a man of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_42" id="Page_42">{42}</a></span>
any other nation, for “high and low, rich and poor, they were
remarkable for cleanness all the world over.”<a name="FNanchor_230_231" id="FNanchor_230_231"></a><a href="#Footnote_230_231" class="fnanchor">[230]</a> Matthew Bramble,
in Smollett’s <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>, notices the same change. “The
boors of Northumberland,” he wrote, “are lusty fellows, fresh-complexioned,
cleanly and well-clothed; but the labourers in Scotland
are generally lank, lean, hard-featured, sallow, soiled and
shabby. The cattle are much in the same style with their drivers,
meagre, stunted, and ill-equipt.”<a name="FNanchor_231_232" id="FNanchor_231_232"></a><a href="#Footnote_231_232" class="fnanchor">[231]</a> Topham, in his <cite>Letters from
Edinburgh</cite>, asserts the misery, but denies the idleness. Temperance
and labour were, he says, in the extreme; nevertheless, on all
sides were seen, “haggard looks, meagre complexions, and bodies
weakened by fatigue and worn down by the inclemency of the
seasons.” Neither were the poor of the capital any better off.
Their wretchedness and poverty exceeded, he thought, what was to
be found anywhere else in the whole world. But though as a
nation the Scotch were very poor, yet they were very honest.<a name="FNanchor_232_233" id="FNanchor_232_233"></a><a href="#Footnote_232_233" class="fnanchor">[232]</a>
A traveller through the country in 1766 goes so far as to maintain
that the common people in outward appearance would not at first
be taken to be of the human species. Though their indigence
was extreme, yet they would rather suffer poverty than labour.
Their nastiness was greater than could be reported. Happily their
rudeness was beginning to wear off, and in the trading towns where
the knowledge of the use of money was making them eager enough
to acquire it, they were already pretty well civilized and industrious.<a name="FNanchor_233_234" id="FNanchor_233_234"></a><a href="#Footnote_233_234" class="fnanchor">[233]</a>
Wages were miserably low. The Scotch labourer received
little more than half what was paid to the Englishman; yet grain
was dearer in Scotland than in England.<a name="FNanchor_234_235" id="FNanchor_234_235"></a><a href="#Footnote_234_235" class="fnanchor">[234]</a> The historian of
Edinburgh thus sums the general condition of the labouring
poor:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The common people have no ideas of the comforts of life. The labourers
and low mechanics live in a very wretched style. Their houses are the receptacles
of nastiness, where the spider may in peace weave his web from generation to
generation. A garden, where nothing is to be seen but a few plants of coleworts or
potatoes, amidst an innumerable quantity of weeds, surrounds his house. A bit of
flesh will not be within his door twice a year. He abhors industry, and has no
relish for the comforts arising from it.”<a name="FNanchor_235_236" id="FNanchor_235_236"></a><a href="#Footnote_235_236" class="fnanchor">[235]</a></p></div>

<p>Lord Elibank’s famous reply to Johnson’s definition of <em>oats</em> had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_43" id="Page_43">{43}</a></span>
every merit but a foundation of fact. “Oats,” wrote Johnson, “a
grain which in England is generally given to horses, but in Scotland
supports the people.” “Very true,” replied his lordship,
“and where will you find such men and such horses?”<a name="FNanchor_236_237" id="FNanchor_236_237"></a><a href="#Footnote_236_237" class="fnanchor">[236]</a></p>

<p>The natural result of this general poverty was seen in the
number of beggars who thronged the streets and roads. Scotland
was neither blessed with a good poor-law nor cursed with a bad
one. The relief of want was left altogether to charity. In Edinburgh
Johnson thought that the proportion of beggars was not less
than in London. “In the smaller places it was far greater than in
English towns of the same extent.” The mendicants were not,
however, of the order of sturdy vagabonds. They were neither
importunate nor clamorous. “They solicit silently, or very
modestly.”<a name="FNanchor_237_238" id="FNanchor_237_238"></a><a href="#Footnote_237_238" class="fnanchor">[237]</a> Smollett went so far as to maintain in his <cite>Humphry
Clinker</cite>, which was published only two years before Johnson’s
visit, that “there was not a beggar to be seen within the precincts
of Edinburgh.”<a name="FNanchor_238_239" id="FNanchor_238_239"></a><a href="#Footnote_238_239" class="fnanchor">[238]</a> For some years, indeed, the streets had been
free of them, for a charity workhouse had been erected, to which
they were all committed. But the magistrates had grown careless,
and the evil had broken out afresh. “The streets are crowded
with begging poor,” wrote one writer. “We see the whole stairs,
streets, and public walks swarming with beggars every day,” wrote
another.<a name="FNanchor_239_240" id="FNanchor_239_240"></a><a href="#Footnote_239_240" class="fnanchor">[239]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOUSES AND MEALS.</div>

<p>The general neglect of the decencies of life was due chiefly to
poverty, but partly, no doubt, to that violent outburst against all
that is beautiful and graceful which accompanied the Reformation
in Scotland. A nation which, as a protest against popery,
“thought dirt and cob-webs essential to the house of God,”<a name="FNanchor_240_241" id="FNanchor_240_241"></a><a href="#Footnote_240_241" class="fnanchor">[240]</a> was
not likely in their homes to hold that cleanliness was next to
godliness. The same coarseness of living had been found in all
classes, though it was beginning to yield before English influence.
Dr. Alexander Carlyle, in the year 1742, notices as a sign of
increasing refinement, that at the tavern in Haddington, where the
Presbytery dined, knives and forks were provided for the table.
A few years earlier each guest had brought his own. There was,
however, only one glass, which went round with the bottle.<a name="FNanchor_241_242" id="FNanchor_241_242"></a><a href="#Footnote_241_242" class="fnanchor">[241]</a> The
same custom had prevailed in Edinburgh when Lord Kames was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_44" id="Page_44">{44}</a></span>
a young man. French wine was placed on the table, he said, in a
small tin vessel, which held about an English pint. A single
drinking-glass served a company the whole evening, and the first
persons who called for a new glass with every new pint were
accused of luxury.<a name="FNanchor_242_243" id="FNanchor_242_243"></a><a href="#Footnote_242_243" class="fnanchor">[242]</a> Boswell could remember the time when a
carving knife was looked upon as a novelty. One of his friends
was rated by his father, “a gentleman of ancient family and good
literature, for introducing such a foppish superfluity.” In the
previous generation whatever food was eaten with a spoon, such as
soup, milk, or pudding, used to be taken by every person dipping
his spoon into the common dish.<a name="FNanchor_243_244" id="FNanchor_243_244"></a><a href="#Footnote_243_244" class="fnanchor">[243]</a> When an old laird was complimented
on the accomplishments which his son had brought
home from his travels, “he answered that he knew nothing he had
learnt but to cast a sark (change a shirt) every day, and to sup his
kail twice.”<a name="FNanchor_244_245" id="FNanchor_244_245"></a><a href="#Footnote_244_245" class="fnanchor">[244]</a> Of the food that was served up, there was not much
greater variety than of the dishes in which it was served. When
Wesley first visited Scotland, even at a nobleman’s table, he had
only one kind of meat, and no vegetables whatever. By the year
1788, however, vegetables were, he recorded, as plentiful as in
England.<a name="FNanchor_245_246" id="FNanchor_245_246"></a><a href="#Footnote_245_246" class="fnanchor">[245]</a> The butter in these early days made in country houses,
“would have turned stomachs the least squeamish.” But by the
introduction of tea a great improvement had been made. Bread
and butter was taken with it, and a demand arose for butter that
was sweet and clean. Wheaten bread, too, began to be generally
eaten. So great a delicacy had it been, that the sixpenny loaf and
the sugar used to be kept “locked up in the lady’s press.”<a name="FNanchor_246_247" id="FNanchor_246_247"></a><a href="#Footnote_246_247" class="fnanchor">[246]</a> In
the Highlands, at all events, there was a great variety as well as
abundance of food. The following was the breakfast which in
Argyleshire was set before the travellers in <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One kit of boiled eggs; a second full of butter; a third full of cream; an
entire cheese made of goat’s milk; a large earthen pot full of honey; the best part
of a ham; a cold venison pasty; a bushel of oatmeal made in thin cakes and
bannocks, with a small wheaten loaf in the middle for the strangers; a large stone
bottle full of whisky, another of brandy, and a kilderkin of ale. There was a ladle
chained to the cream kit, with curious wooden bickers to be filled from this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_45" id="Page_45">{45}</a></span>
reservoir. The spirits were drunk out of a silver quaff, and the ale out of horns.
Finally a large roll of tobacco was presented by way of desert, and every individual
took a comfortable quid, to prevent the bad effects of the morning air.”<a name="FNanchor_247_248" id="FNanchor_247_248"></a><a href="#Footnote_247_248" class="fnanchor">[247]</a></p></div>

<p>Knox, in his <cite>Tour through the Highlands</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_248_249" id="FNanchor_248_249"></a><a href="#Footnote_248_249" class="fnanchor">[248]</a> gives a still vaster
bill of fare. The houses of the country gentlemen were for the
most part small. “It was only on festivals or upon ceremonious
occasions, that the dining-room was used. People lived mostly in
the family bed-chamber, where friends and neighbours were
received without scruple. Many an easy, comfortable meal,”
writes Ramsay, of Ochtertyre, “had I made in that way.”<a name="FNanchor_249_250" id="FNanchor_249_250"></a><a href="#Footnote_249_250" class="fnanchor">[249]</a> It
was to this custom that the Scotch had of turning a bed-room into
an eating-room that an English traveller refers, when he says that
the Edinburgh taverns are the worst in the world, for “you sup
underground in a bed-chamber.”<a name="FNanchor_250_251" id="FNanchor_250_251"></a><a href="#Footnote_250_251" class="fnanchor">[250]</a> Even at the modern houses
there was generally a total absence of an accommodation such as
would not at the present day be tolerated in a labourer’s cottage
by a sanitary inspector in any district in England.<a name="FNanchor_251_252" id="FNanchor_251_252"></a><a href="#Footnote_251_252" class="fnanchor">[251]</a></p>

<p>The state of the capital was far worse even than the state of
the country. It was one of the last places in the world on which
would have been bestowed that favourite and almost exalted
epithet of praise&mdash;<em>neat</em>.<a name="FNanchor_252_253" id="FNanchor_252_253"></a><a href="#Footnote_252_253" class="fnanchor">[252]</a> The houses, indeed, were solidly built,
and the rooms of the well-to-do people were comfortable and clean,
and often spacious. “Nothing could form a stronger contrast than
the difference between the outside and the inside of the door.”
Within all was decency and propriety, without was a filthy staircase
leading down into a filthy street. Every story was a complete
house, occupied by a separate family. The steep and dark
staircase was common to all, and was kept clean by none. It was
put to the basest uses.<a name="FNanchor_253_254" id="FNanchor_253_254"></a><a href="#Footnote_253_254" class="fnanchor">[253]</a> The gentry did not commonly occupy the
lowest stories or the highest. The following is the list of the
inhabitants of a good house in the High Street:&mdash;</p>


<ul><li>“First door upstairs, Mr. Stirling, fishmonger.</li>
<li>Second door, Mrs. Urquhart, who kept a lodging-house of good repute.</li>
<li>Third flat, the Dowager Countess of Balcarras.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_46" id="Page_46">{46}</a></span></li>
<li>Fourth flat, Mrs. Buchan, of Kelly.</li>
<li>Fifth flat, the Misses Elliots, milliners.</li>
<li>Garrets, a great variety of tailors and other tradesmen.”<a name="FNanchor_254_255" id="FNanchor_254_255"></a><a href="#Footnote_254_255" class="fnanchor">[254]</a></li>
</ul>

<div class="sidenote">THE SCAVENGING OF EDINBURGH.</div>

<p>There were no water pipes, there were no drain pipes, there
were no cess-pools, and there were no covered sewers in the streets.
At a fixed hour of the night all the impurities were carried down
the common staircase in tubs, and emptied into the street as into a
common sewer, or else, in defiance of the law, cast out of the
window. “Throwing over the window” was the delicate phrase in
which this vile practice was veiled. It was “an obstinate disease
which had withstood all the labour of the Magistrates, Acts of Council,
Dean of Guild Courts for stencheling,<a name="FNanchor_255_256" id="FNanchor_255_256"></a><a href="#Footnote_255_256" class="fnanchor">[255]</a> tirlesing,<a name="FNanchor_256_257" id="FNanchor_256_257"></a><a href="#Footnote_256_257" class="fnanchor">[256]</a> and locking up
windows, fines, imprisonments, and banishing the city.”<a name="FNanchor_257_258" id="FNanchor_257_258"></a><a href="#Footnote_257_258" class="fnanchor">[257]</a> The
servants were willing to serve for lower wages in houses where this
practice was winked at. It gave rise to numerous quarrels which
caused constables more trouble than any other part of their duty.<a name="FNanchor_258_259" id="FNanchor_258_259"></a><a href="#Footnote_258_259" class="fnanchor">[258]</a>
According to the account given by the English maid in <cite>Humphry
Clinker</cite>, when “the throwing over” began, “they called <em>gardy loo</em>
to the passengers, which signifies <em>Lord have mercy upon you</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_259_260" id="FNanchor_259_260"></a><a href="#Footnote_259_260" class="fnanchor">[259]</a> A
young English traveller, who, the first night of his arrival in Edinburgh,
was enjoying his supper, as he tells us, and good bottle of
claret with a merry company in a tavern, heard, as the clock was
striking ten, the beat of the city drum, the signal for the scavenging
to begin. The company at once began to fumigate the room by
lighting pieces of paper and throwing them on the table. Tobacco
smoking, it is clear, could not have been in fashion. As his way to
his lodgings lay through one of the wynds he was provided “with
a guide who went before him, crying out all the way, <em>Hud your
Haunde</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_260_261" id="FNanchor_260_261"></a><a href="#Footnote_260_261" class="fnanchor">[260]</a> The city scavengers cleansed the streets as fast as they
could, and by opening reservoirs which were placed at intervals
washed the pavement clean.<a name="FNanchor_261_262" id="FNanchor_261_262"></a><a href="#Footnote_261_262" class="fnanchor">[261]</a></p>

<p>To this intolerable nuisance the inhabitants generally seemed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_47" id="Page_47">{47}</a></span>
insensible, and were too apt to imagine the disgust of strangers as
little better than affectation.<a name="FNanchor_262_263" id="FNanchor_262_263"></a><a href="#Footnote_262_263" class="fnanchor">[262]</a> Yet it was not affectation which led
John Wesley, in May, 1761, to make the following entry in his
Journal:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The situation of the city on a hill shelving down on both sides, as well as to the
east, with the stately castle upon a craggy rock on the west, is inexpressibly fine.
And the main street so broad and finely paved, with the lofty houses on either hand
(many of them seven or eight stories high) is far beyond any in Great Britain. But
how can it be suffered that all manner of filth should still be thrown, even into this
street, continually? Where are the Magistracy, the Gentry, the Nobility of the Land?
Have they no concern for the honour of their nation? How long shall the
capital city of Scotland, yea and the chief street of it, stink worse than a common
sewer?”<a name="FNanchor_263_264" id="FNanchor_263_264"></a><a href="#Footnote_263_264" class="fnanchor">[263]</a></p></div>

<p>Ten years earlier he had described the town as dirtier even
than Cologne. According to Wolfe, it was not till after Christmas,
when the company had come into it from the country, that it was
“in all its perfection of dirt and gaiety.”<a name="FNanchor_264_265" id="FNanchor_264_265"></a><a href="#Footnote_264_265" class="fnanchor">[264]</a> Gray called it “that
most picturesque (at a distance) and nastiest (when near) of all
capital cities.”<a name="FNanchor_265_266" id="FNanchor_265_266"></a><a href="#Footnote_265_266" class="fnanchor">[265]</a> “Pray for me till I see you,” he added, “for
I dread Edinburgh and the &mdash;.”<a name="FNanchor_266_267" id="FNanchor_266_267"></a><a href="#Footnote_266_267" class="fnanchor">[266]</a> To add to the insalubrity, the
windows would not readily open. In Scotland they neither opened
wide on hinges, nor were drawn up and down by weights and
pulleys. For the most part the lower sash only could be raised; and
when lifted, it was propped open by a stick or by a pin thrust into
a hole.<a name="FNanchor_267_268" id="FNanchor_267_268"></a><a href="#Footnote_267_268" class="fnanchor">[267]</a> “What cannot be done without some uncommon trouble
or particular expedient will not often be done at all. The incommodiousness
of the Scotch windows keeps them very closely shut.”<a name="FNanchor_268_269" id="FNanchor_268_269"></a><a href="#Footnote_268_269" class="fnanchor">[268]</a>
From this closeness Johnson suffered not a little, for he loved fresh
air, “and on the coldest day or night would set open a window and
stand before it,” as Boswell knew to his cost.<a name="FNanchor_269_270" id="FNanchor_269_270"></a><a href="#Footnote_269_270" class="fnanchor">[269]</a> Topham, who sided
with his Scotch friends against Johnson, scoffed at these observations
on window-frames and pulleys. “Men of the world,”
he wrote, “would not have descended to such remarks. A petty
and frivolous detail of trifling circumstances are [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] the certain
signs of ignorance or inexperience.”<a name="FNanchor_270_271" id="FNanchor_270_271"></a><a href="#Footnote_270_271" class="fnanchor">[270]</a> Johnson, in introducing the
subject, had guarded himself against such reflections. “These
diminutive observations,” he said, “seem to take away something<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_48" id="Page_48">{48}</a></span>
from the dignity of writing. But it must be remembered that the
true state of every nation is the state of common life.”<a name="FNanchor_271_272" id="FNanchor_271_272"></a><a href="#Footnote_271_272" class="fnanchor">[271]</a> This
indifference to pure air no doubt spread death far and wide. In
Sir Walter Scott’s family we see an instance of the unwholesomeness
of the Old Town. His six elder brothers and sisters, who were all
born in the College Wynd, died young. It was only by sending
him to breathe country air that he was reared. His father’s younger
children were born in one of the new squares, and they for the most
part were healthy.<a name="FNanchor_272_273" id="FNanchor_272_273"></a><a href="#Footnote_272_273" class="fnanchor">[272]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ABOLITION OF VAILS.</div>

<p>From one burthen that weighed heavily in England the guests
in most houses in Scotland were free. It was the Scotch, who, as
Boswell boasted, “had the honour of being the first to abolish the
unhospitable, troublesome, and ungracious custom of giving vails to
servants. ‘Sir,’ said Johnson, ‘you abolished vails, because you
were too poor to be able to give them.’”<a name="FNanchor_273_274" id="FNanchor_273_274"></a><a href="#Footnote_273_274" class="fnanchor">[273]</a> How heavily they
weighed on all but the rich is shown by an anecdote that I have read
somewhere of a poor gentleman, who refused to dine with his kinsman,
a nobleman of high rank, unless with the invitation a guinea
were sent him to distribute among the expectant servants, who,
with outstretched hands, always thronged the hall and blocked up
the doorway as he left. “I paid ten shillings to my host’s servants
for my dinner and retired,” is the record of a man who had received
the honour of an invitation to the house of an English nobleman of
high rank.<a name="FNanchor_274_275" id="FNanchor_274_275"></a><a href="#Footnote_274_275" class="fnanchor">[274]</a> Even Queen Caroline had complained of “the pretty
large expense” to which she had been put in the summer of 1735
in visiting her friends, not at their country houses, but in town.
“That is your own fault (said the King), for my father, when
he went to people’s houses in town, never was fool enough to
be giving away his money.”<a name="FNanchor_275_276" id="FNanchor_275_276"></a><a href="#Footnote_275_276" class="fnanchor">[275]</a> It was to the gentlemen of the
county of Aberdeen that was due the merit of beginning this
great reformation. About the year 1759 they resolved at a
public meeting that vails should be abolished and wages increased.<a name="FNanchor_276_277" id="FNanchor_276_277"></a><a href="#Footnote_276_277" class="fnanchor">[276]</a>
Early in February, 1760, the Select Society of Edinburgh,
following their lead, passed a resolution to which their
President, the historian Robertson, seems to have lent the graces of
his style. They declared that “this custom, being unknown to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_49" id="Page_49">{49}</a></span>
other nations and a reproach upon the manners and police of this
country, has a manifest tendency to corrupt the hospitality and
to destroy all intercourse between families. They resolved that
from and after the term of Whitsuntide next every member of the
Society would absolutely prohibit his own servants to take vails or
drink-money, and that he would not offer it to the servants of any
person who had agreed to this resolution.”<a name="FNanchor_277_278" id="FNanchor_277_278"></a><a href="#Footnote_277_278" class="fnanchor">[277]</a> Like resolutions
followed from the Faculty of Advocates, the Society of Clerks
to His Majesty’s Signet, the Heritors of Mid-Lothian headed
by the Earl of Lauderdale, the Grand Lodge of Freemasons, headed
by the Earl of Leven, and the Honourable Company of Scots
Hunters headed by the President, the Earl of Errol.<a name="FNanchor_278_279" id="FNanchor_278_279"></a><a href="#Footnote_278_279" class="fnanchor">[278]</a> The same
good change was attempted a few years later in England, but
apparently without success. The footmen, night after night, raised
a riot at Ranelagh Gardens, and mobbed and ill-treated some
gentlemen who had been active in the attempt. “There was
fighting with drawn swords for some hours; they broke one chariot
all to pieces. The ladies go into fits, scream, run into the gardens,
and do everything that is ridiculous.”<a name="FNanchor_279_280" id="FNanchor_279_280"></a><a href="#Footnote_279_280" class="fnanchor">[279]</a></p>

<p>That “felicity” which England had in its taverns and inns was
not equally enjoyed in Scotland. Certainly it was not in Edinburgh
that was to be found “that throne of human felicity a tavern
chair.”<a name="FNanchor_280_281" id="FNanchor_280_281"></a><a href="#Footnote_280_281" class="fnanchor">[280]</a> Yet in the Lowlands generally the fare in the inns was
good and the accommodation clean. Along both the eastern and
the western roads John Wesley was well pleased with the entertainment
with which he met. “We had all things good, cheap, in great
abundance, and remarkably well dressed.”<a name="FNanchor_281_282" id="FNanchor_281_282"></a><a href="#Footnote_281_282" class="fnanchor">[281]</a> In the <cite>Gentleman’s
Magazine</cite> for December, 1771, a curious list is given of the inns
and innkeepers in Scotland. According to this account the fare
generally was good, while everywhere was found “excellent clean
linen both for bed and board.” The traveller did well, however,
who had his sheets <em>toasted</em> and his bed warmed, for the natives,
used as they were to sleeping in their wet plaids, were careless
about a damp bed. Goldsmith, on the other hand, spoke as ill of
the Scotch inns as he did of the Scotch landscape. In them, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">{50}</a></span>
says, “vile entertainment is served up, complained of, and sent
down; up comes worse, and that also is changed, and every change
makes our wretched cheer more unsavoury.”<a name="FNanchor_282_283" id="FNanchor_282_283"></a><a href="#Footnote_282_283" class="fnanchor">[282]</a> The scantiness of
his purse, however, would have made him resort to the humblest
houses, and probably his experience did not extend much outside
of Edinburgh. Of the inns of that city, no one, whether native or
stranger, had a good word to say. The accommodation that was
provided, writes the historian of Edinburgh, “was little better than
that of a waggoner or a carrier.”<a name="FNanchor_283_284" id="FNanchor_283_284"></a><a href="#Footnote_283_284" class="fnanchor">[283]</a> “The inns are mean buildings,”
he continues, “their apartments dirty and dismal; and if the waiters
happen to be out of the way, a stranger will perhaps be shocked
with the novelty of being shown into a room by a dirty sun-burnt
wench without shoes or stockings. If he should desire furnished
lodgings, he is probably conducted to the third or fourth floor, up
dark and dirty stairs, and there shown into apartments meanly
fitted up. The taverns in general are dirty and dismal as the inns;
an idle profusion of victuals, collected without taste, and dressed
without skill or cleanliness, is commonly served up. There are,
however, exceptions, and a Scots tavern, if a good one, is the best
of all taverns.”<a name="FNanchor_284_285" id="FNanchor_284_285"></a><a href="#Footnote_284_285" class="fnanchor">[284]</a> Smollett, willing as he was to see the good side
of everything in Scotland, yet represents the inn in Edinburgh at
which Matthew Bramble alighted as being “so filthy and so disagreeable
in every respect, that the old man began to fret.”<a name="FNanchor_285_286" id="FNanchor_285_286"></a><a href="#Footnote_285_286" class="fnanchor">[285]</a>
Perhaps it was the same house which is described by Topham in
the following lively passage in his <cite>Letters</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_286_287" id="FNanchor_286_287"></a><a href="#Footnote_286_287" class="fnanchor">[286]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nov. 15, 1774. There is no inn that is better than an alehouse, nor any
accommodation that is decent or cleanly. On my first arrival my companion and
myself, after the fatigue of a long day’s journey, were landed at one of these stable-keepers
(for they have modesty enough to give themselves no higher denomination)
in a part of the town called the Pleasance.<a name="FNanchor_287_288" id="FNanchor_287_288"></a><a href="#Footnote_287_288" class="fnanchor">[287]</a> We were conducted by a poor devil of
a girl, without shoes or stockings, and only a single linsey-wolsey petticoat, which
just reached half-way to her ankles, into a room where about twenty Scotch drovers
had been regaling themselves with whiskey and potatoes. You may guess our
amazement when we were informed that this was the best inn in the metropolis,
that we could have no beds, unless we had an inclination to sleep together, and
in the same room with the company which a stage-coach had that moment discharged.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">EDINBURGH STABLERS.</div>

<p>In the <cite>Edinburgh Directory</cite> for 1773-4, among the different<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_51" id="Page_51">{51}</a></span>
trades, there is no entry under the heading of <em>inn-keepers</em>. There
are <em>vintners</em>, who, I suppose, were also tavern-keepers, and <em>stablers</em>,
who kept the inns. It was to this curious appellation that Topham
referred when he said that the inn-keepers had the modesty to call
themselves stable-keepers.</p>

<p>A few years after Johnson’s visit a good hotel was at last
opened in the New Town. The accommodation was elegant, but
the charges extravagant.<a name="FNanchor_288_289" id="FNanchor_288_289"></a><a href="#Footnote_288_289" class="fnanchor">[288]</a> The French traveller, Saint Fond, who
stayed in it about the year 1780, said that the house was magnificent
and adorned with columns, as his bill was with flourishes and
vignettes. Half a sheet of note-paper was charged threepence,
with sixpence added for the trouble of fetching it. He paid twice
as much for everything as in the best inn on the road from London.
In all his journeyings through England and Scotland he was only
twice charged exorbitantly&mdash;at Dunn’s Hotel in Edinburgh, and at
the Bull’s Head in Manchester.<a name="FNanchor_289_290" id="FNanchor_289_290"></a><a href="#Footnote_289_290" class="fnanchor">[289]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE HIGH STREET OF EDINBURGH.</div>

<p>Johnson, coming from Berwick by the coast-road, entered
Edinburgh by the Canongate. It was on a dusky night in August
that, arm in arm with Boswell, he walked up the High Street.
“Its breadth and the loftiness of the buildings on each side made,”
he acknowledged, “a noble appearance.”<a name="FNanchor_290_291" id="FNanchor_290_291"></a><a href="#Footnote_290_291" class="fnanchor">[290]</a> In the light of the day
he does not seem to have been equally impressed. “Most of the
buildings are very mean,” he wrote to Mrs. Thrale; “and the whole
town bears some resemblance to the old part of Birmingham.”<a name="FNanchor_291_292" id="FNanchor_291_292"></a><a href="#Footnote_291_292" class="fnanchor">[291]</a> In
his Letters he does not touch on that appearance so unusual to
Englishmen which, as we learn from his narrative, generally struck
him in the ancient towns of Scotland.<a name="FNanchor_292_293" id="FNanchor_292_293"></a><a href="#Footnote_292_293" class="fnanchor">[292]</a> Wesley’s attention was
caught by this same “peculiar oddness” and “air of antiquity.”
They were like no places that he had ever seen in England, Wales,
or Ireland.<a name="FNanchor_293_294" id="FNanchor_293_294"></a><a href="#Footnote_293_294" class="fnanchor">[293]</a> It was not, however, to Birmingham that that great
traveller likened the famous High Street. There was nothing, he
said, that could compare with it in Great Britain. Defoe’s admiration
had risen still higher. In his eyes it ranked as almost the
largest, longest, and finest street in the world. Its solidity of stone
he contrasted with the slightness of the houses in the South. Lofty
though the buildings were, placed, too, on “the narrow ridge of a
long ascending mountain,” with storms often raging round them,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_52" id="Page_52">{52}</a></span>
“there was no blowing of tiles about the streets to knock people on
the heads as they passed; no stacks of chimneys and gable-ends of
houses falling in to bury the inhabitants in their ruins, as was often
found in London and other of our paper-built cities in England.”<a name="FNanchor_294_295" id="FNanchor_294_295"></a><a href="#Footnote_294_295" class="fnanchor">[294]</a>
“The High Street is the stateliest street in the world,” said another
writer; “being broad enough for five coaches to drive up a-breast,
while the houses are proportionately high.”<a name="FNanchor_295_296" id="FNanchor_295_296"></a><a href="#Footnote_295_296" class="fnanchor">[295]</a> According to Topham
it surpassed “the famous street in Lisle, La Rue Royale.”<a name="FNanchor_296_297" id="FNanchor_296_297"></a><a href="#Footnote_296_297" class="fnanchor">[296]</a> “It
would be undoubtedly one of the noblest streets in Europe,” wrote
Smollett, “if an ugly mass of mean buildings, called the Luckenbooths,
had not thrust itself into the middle of the way.”<a name="FNanchor_297_298" id="FNanchor_297_298"></a><a href="#Footnote_297_298" class="fnanchor">[297]</a> Pennant
had the same tale to tell. “As fine a street as most in Europe,
was spoilt by the Luckenbooth Row and the Guard House.”<a name="FNanchor_298_299" id="FNanchor_298_299"></a><a href="#Footnote_298_299" class="fnanchor">[298]</a>
Carlyle, when he came to Edinburgh as a boy-student, in the year
1809, had seen “the Luckenbooths, with their strange little ins and
outs, and eager old women in miniature shops of combs, shoe-laces,
and trifles.”<a name="FNanchor_299_300" id="FNanchor_299_300"></a><a href="#Footnote_299_300" class="fnanchor">[299]</a> One venerable monument had been wantonly removed,
while so much that was mean and ugly was left to encumber
the street. In 1756 those “dull destroyers,” the magistrates, had
pulled down “Dun-Edin’s Cross.”<a name="FNanchor_300_301" id="FNanchor_300_301"></a><a href="#Footnote_300_301" class="fnanchor">[300]</a> From the bottom of the hill
“by the very Palace door,” up to the gates of the Castle the High
Street, even so late as Johnson’s time, was the home of men of
rank, of wealth, and of learning. It did not bear that look of sullen
neglect which chills the stranger who recalls its past glories. The
craftsmen and the nobles, the poor clerks and the wealthy merchants,
judges, shopkeepers, labourers, authors, physicians, and lawyers,
lived all side by side, so that “the tide of existence” which swept
up and down was as varied as it was full. The coldness of the
grey stone of the tall houses was relieved by the fantastic devices
in red or yellow or blue on a ground of black, by which each trader
signified the commodities in which he dealt. As each story was a
separate abode, there were often seen painted on the front of one
tall house half-a-dozen different signs. Here was a quartern loaf
over a full-trimmed periwig, and there a Cheshire cheese or a rich
firkin of butter over stays and petticoats.<a name="FNanchor_301_302" id="FNanchor_301_302"></a><a href="#Footnote_301_302" class="fnanchor">[301]</a> To the north, scarcely
broken as yet by the scattered buildings of the infant New Town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_53" id="Page_53">{53}</a></span>
the outlook commanded that “incomparable prospect” which delighted
Colonel Mannering, as he gazed from the window of Counsellor
Pleydell’s library on “the Frith of Forth with its islands; the
embayment which is terminated by the Law of North Berwick, and
the varied shores of Fife, indenting with a hilly outline the clear
blue horizon.”<a name="FNanchor_302_303" id="FNanchor_302_303"></a><a href="#Footnote_302_303" class="fnanchor">[302]</a></p>

<p>Every Sunday during the hours of service the streets were
silent and solitary, as if a plague had laid waste the city. But in a
moment the scene was changed. The multitude that poured forth
from each church swept everything before it. The stranger who
attempted to face it was driven from side to side by the advancing
flood. The faithful were so intently meditating on the good things
which they had just heard that they had no time to look before
them. With their large prayer-books under their arms, their eyes
fixed steadily on the ground, and wrapped up in their plaid cloaks,
they went on regardless of everything that passed.<a name="FNanchor_303_304" id="FNanchor_303_304"></a><a href="#Footnote_303_304" class="fnanchor">[303]</a></p>

<p>Less than thirty years before Johnson, on that August night,
“went up streets,”<a name="FNanchor_304_305" id="FNanchor_304_305"></a><a href="#Footnote_304_305" class="fnanchor">[304]</a> the young Pretender, surrounded by his Highlanders,
and preceded by his heralds and trumpeters, had marched
from the Palace of his ancestors to the ancient Market Cross, and
there had had his father proclaimed King by the title of James the
Seventh of Scotland and Third of England. Down the same street
in the following Spring his own standard, with its proud motto of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Tandem Triumphans</i>, and the banners of thirteen of his chief captains,
in like manner preceded by heralds and trumpeters, had been
borne on the shoulders of the common hangman and thirteen
chimney-sweepers, to the same Cross, and there publicly burnt.<a name="FNanchor_305_306" id="FNanchor_305_306"></a><a href="#Footnote_305_306" class="fnanchor">[305]</a>
Here, too, was seen from time to time the sad and terrible procession,
when, from the Tolbooth, some unhappy wretch was led forth
to die in the Grass Market. As the clock struck the hour after
noon, the City Guard knocked at the prison door. The convict at
once came out, dressed in a waistcoat and breeches of white, bound
with black ribands, and wearing a night-cap, also bound with black.
His hands were tied behind him, and a rope was round his neck.
On each side of him walked a clergyman, the hangman followed bemuffled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_54" id="Page_54">{54}</a></span>
in a great coat, while all around, with their arms
ready, marched the Town Guard. Every window in every floor of
every house was crowded with spectators.<a name="FNanchor_306_307" id="FNanchor_306_307"></a><a href="#Footnote_306_307" class="fnanchor">[306]</a> Happily the criminal
law of Scotland was far less bloody than that which at this time
disgraced England, and executions, except for murder, were rare.<a name="FNanchor_307_308" id="FNanchor_307_308"></a><a href="#Footnote_307_308" class="fnanchor">[307]</a>
There was also much less crime. While the streets and neighbourhood
of London were beset by footpads and highwaymen, in Edinburgh
a man might go about with the same security at midnight as
at noonday. Street robberies were very rare, and a street murder
was, it is said, a thing unknown. This general safety was due
partly to the Town Guard,<a name="FNanchor_308_309" id="FNanchor_308_309"></a><a href="#Footnote_308_309" class="fnanchor">[308]</a> partly also to the Society of Cadies, or
Cawdies, a fraternity of errand-runners. Each member had to find
surety for good behaviour, and the whole body was answerable for
the dishonesty of each. Their chief place of stand was at the top
of the High Street, where some of them were found all the day and
most of the night. They were said to be acquainted with every
person and every place in Edinburgh. No stranger arrived but
they knew of it at once. They acted as a kind of police, and were
as useful as Sir John Fielding’s thief-takers in London.<a name="FNanchor_309_310" id="FNanchor_309_310"></a><a href="#Footnote_309_310" class="fnanchor">[309]</a> In spite
of these safeguards, in the autumn before Johnson’s visit there was
an outbreak of crime. A reward of one guinea each was offered
for the arrest of forty persons who had been banished the city, and
who were suspected of having returned.<a name="FNanchor_310_311" id="FNanchor_310_311"></a><a href="#Footnote_310_311" class="fnanchor">[310]</a> The worthy Magistrates,
it should seem, were like Dogberry, and did not trouble themselves
about a thief so long as he stole out of their company.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE EDINBURGH TOLBOOTH.</div>

<p>The Edinburgh Tolbooth and the other Scotch gaols were
worse even than those cruel dens in which the miserable prisoners
were confined in England. They had no court-yard where the
fresh air of heaven might be breathed for some hours at least of
every weary day. Not even to the unhappy debtor was any
indulgence shown. That air was denied to him which was common
to all. Even under a guard, said an expounder of the law,
he had no right to the benefit of free air; “for every creditor has<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_55" id="Page_55">{55}</a></span>
an interest that his debtor be kept under close confinement, that
by his <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">squalor carceris</i> he may be brought to the payment of his
just debt.”<a name="FNanchor_311_312" id="FNanchor_311_312"></a><a href="#Footnote_311_312" class="fnanchor">[311]</a> He was to learn the fulness of the meaning of “the
curse of a severe creditor who pronounces his debtor’s doom, <em>To
Rot in Gaol</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_312_313" id="FNanchor_312_313"></a><a href="#Footnote_312_313" class="fnanchor">[312]</a> At the present time even in Siberia there cannot, I
believe, be found so cruel a den as that old Edinburgh Tolbooth,
by whose gloomy walls
Johnson passed on his way
to Boswell’s comfortable
home close by, where Mrs.
Boswell and tea were awaiting
him. In one room
were found by a writer who
visited the prison three
lads confined among “the
refuse of a long succession
of criminals.” The straw
which was their bed had
been worn into bits two
inches long. In a room on
the floor above were two
miserable boys not twelve
years old. But the stench
that assailed him as the
door was opened so overpowered
him that he fled.
The accumulation of dirt
which he saw in the rooms
and on the staircases was
so great, that it set him speculating in vain on the length of
time which must have been required to make it. The supply
of the food and drink was the jailer’s monopoly; whenever the
poor wretches received a little money from friends outside, or
from charity, they were not allowed the benefit of the market price.
The choice of the debtor’s prison was left to the caprice of his
creditor, and that which was known to be the most loathsome was
often selected.<a name="FNanchor_313_314" id="FNanchor_313_314"></a><a href="#Footnote_313_314" class="fnanchor">[313]</a> The summer after Johnson’s visit to Edinburgh<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_56" id="Page_56">{56}</a></span>
John Wesley, in one of the streets of that town, was suddenly
arrested by a sheriff’s officer on a warrant to commit him to the
Tolbooth. Happily he was first taken to an adjoining building&mdash;some
kind of spunging-house, it is probable&mdash;whence he sent word
to his friends, and obtained bail. The charge brought against him
was ridiculous, and in the end the prosecutor had heavy damages
to pay.<a name="FNanchor_314_315" id="FNanchor_314_315"></a><a href="#Footnote_314_315" class="fnanchor">[314]</a> Nevertheless, monstrous though the accusation was, had
Wesley been not only a stranger and poor, but also friendless, it
was in that miserable den that he would have been lodged. His
deliverance might have been by gaol-fever.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DOUGLAS CAUSE RIOT.</div>

<p>Boswell himself, if we may trust the tradition, little more than
four years before he welcomed Johnson, had run a risk of becoming
acquainted with the inside of that prison. Scotland was all ablaze
with the great Douglas cause. The succession to the large estates
of the last Duke of Douglas was in dispute; so eagerly did men
share in the shifting course of the long lawsuit, that it was scarcely
safe to open the lips about it in mixed company. Boswell, with
all the warmth of his eager nature, took the part of the heir whose
legitimacy was disallowed by the casting vote of the President in
the Court of Session. The case was carried on appeal to the
House of Lords, and on Monday, February 27, 1769, the Scotch
decision was reversed. A little before eight o’clock on Thursday
evening the news reached Edinburgh by express. The city was
at once illuminated, and the windows of the hostile judges were
broken. Boswell, it is said, headed the mob. That his own
father’s house was among those which he and his followers attacked,
as Sir Walter Scott had heard,<a name="FNanchor_315_316" id="FNanchor_315_316"></a><a href="#Footnote_315_316" class="fnanchor">[315]</a> is very unlikely: Lord
Auchinleck had voted in the minority, and so would have been in
high favour with the rioters. A party of foot soldiers was marched
into the city, a reward of fifty pounds was offered for the discovery
of the offenders, and for some nights the streets were patrolled by
two troops of dragoons.<a name="FNanchor_316_317" id="FNanchor_316_317"></a><a href="#Footnote_316_317" class="fnanchor">[316]</a> “Boswell’s good father,” writes Ramsay
of Ochtertyre, “entreated the President with tears in his eyes to
put his son in the Tolbooth. Being brought before Sheriff Cockburn
for examination, he was desired to tell all that happened that
night in his own way. ‘After,’ said he, ‘I had communicated the
glorious news to my father, who received it very coolly, I went to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_57" id="Page_57">{57}</a></span>
the Cross to see what was going on. There I overheard a group
of fellows forming their plan of operations. One of them asked
what sort of a man the sheriff was, and whether he was not to be
dreaded. ‘No, no,’ answered another; ‘he is a puppy of the
President’s making.’ On hearing this exordium Mr. Cockburn
went off, leaving the culprit to himself.”<a name="FNanchor_317_318" id="FNanchor_317_318"></a><a href="#Footnote_317_318" class="fnanchor">[317]</a></p>

<div class="caption">HUME’S HOUSE.</div>
</div>

<p>Among the sights which Johnson was shown at Edinburgh, the
New Town was not included. Yet some progress had been made
in laying out those streets,
“which in simplicity and
manliness of style and general
breadth and brightness
of effect” were destined
to surpass anything
that has been attempted
in modern street architecture.<a name="FNanchor_318_319" id="FNanchor_318_319"></a><a href="#Footnote_318_319" class="fnanchor">[318]</a>
From Boswell’s
windows, over the tops of
the stately elm-trees which
at that time ran in front of
James’s Court and across
a deep and marshy hollow,
the rising houses could be
easily seen. Full in view
among the rest was the
new home Hume had
lately built for himself at
the top of a street which
was as yet unnamed, but
was soon, as St. David’s, to commemorate in a jest the great
philosopher who was its first inhabitant. Had the change which
was so rapidly coming over Auld Reekie been understood in its
full extent, surely Johnson’s attention would have been drawn to
it. Boswell only mentions the New Town to introduce the name
of “the ingenious architect” who planned it, Craig, the nephew
of the poet Thomson.<a name="FNanchor_319_320" id="FNanchor_319_320"></a><a href="#Footnote_319_320" class="fnanchor">[319]</a> His mind, perhaps, was so set on
escaping from “the too narrow sphere of Scotland,” and on removing<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_58" id="Page_58">{58}</a></span>
to London, that of Edinburgh and its fortunes he was
careless. Yet, shrewd observer as he was of men and manners,
he must have noticed how the tide of fashion had already begun
to set from the Old Town, and was threatening to leave the
ancient homes of the noble and the wealthy like so many wrecks
behind. In many people there was a great reluctance to make a
move. To some the old familiar life in a flat was dear, and the
New Town was built after the English fashion, in what was known
as “houses to themselves.” “One old lady fancied she should be
lost if she were to get into such an habitation; another feared
being blown away in going over the New Bridge; while a third
thought that these new fashions could come to <em>nae gude</em>.”<a name="FNanchor_320_321" id="FNanchor_320_321"></a><a href="#Footnote_320_321" class="fnanchor">[320]</a> Nevertheless,
in spite of all these terrors, the change came very swiftly.
So early as 1783, “a rouping-wife, or saleswoman of old furniture,”
occupied the house which not many years before had been Lord
President Craigie’s, while a chairman who had taken Lord Drummore’s
house had “lately left it for want of accommodation.”<a name="FNanchor_321_322" id="FNanchor_321_322"></a><a href="#Footnote_321_322" class="fnanchor">[321]</a> There
were men of position, however, who, fashion or no fashion, clung
to their old homes for many years later. Queensberry House,
nearly at the foot of the Canongate, which in later years was
turned into a Refuge for the Destitute, so late as 1803 was
inhabited by the Lord Chief Baron Montgomery. Lord Cockburn
remembered well the old judge’s tall, well-dressed figure in
the old style, and the brilliant company which gathered round him
in that ancient but decayed quarter.<a name="FNanchor_322_323" id="FNanchor_322_323"></a><a href="#Footnote_322_323" class="fnanchor">[322]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW TOWN OF EDINBURGH.</div>

<p>It was full five years before Johnson’s arrival that Dr. Robertson,
pleading the cause of his poverty-stricken University, pointed
out how the large buildings that were rising suddenly on all sides,
the magnificent bridge that had been begun, and the new streets and
squares all bore the marks of a country growing in arts and in
industry.<a name="FNanchor_323_324" id="FNanchor_323_324"></a><a href="#Footnote_323_324" class="fnanchor">[323]</a> It was in 1765 that the foundations were laid of the
bridge which was to cross the valley that separates the Old and
New Town. It was not till 1772 that “it was made passable.”<a name="FNanchor_324_325" id="FNanchor_324_325"></a><a href="#Footnote_324_325" class="fnanchor">[324]</a>
In 1783 the huge mound was begun which now so conveniently
joins the two hills. The earth of which it is formed was dug out
in making the foundations of the new houses. Fifteen hundred
cartloads on an average were thrown in daily for the space of three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_59" id="Page_59">{59}</a></span>
years.<a name="FNanchor_325_326" id="FNanchor_325_326"></a><a href="#Footnote_325_326" class="fnanchor">[325]</a> The valley, which with its lawns, its slopes, its trim walls,
its beds of flowers, and its trees, adds so much to the pleasantness
and beauty of Edinburgh, was when Johnson looked down into it
“a deep morass, one of the dirtiest puddles upon earth.”<a name="FNanchor_326_327" id="FNanchor_326_327"></a><a href="#Footnote_326_327" class="fnanchor">[326]</a> It was
in its black mud that Hume one day stuck when he had slipped
off the stepping-stones on the way to his new house. A fishwife,
who was following after him, recognizing “the Deist,” refused to
help him unless he should recite first the Lord’s Prayer and the
Belief.<a name="FNanchor_327_328" id="FNanchor_327_328"></a><a href="#Footnote_327_328" class="fnanchor">[327]</a> This he at once did to her great wonder. His admiration
for the New Town was unbounded. If the High Street was finer
than anything of its kind in Europe the New Town, he maintained,
exceeded anything in any part of the world.<a name="FNanchor_328_329" id="FNanchor_328_329"></a><a href="#Footnote_328_329" class="fnanchor">[328]</a> “You would not
wonder that I have abjured London for ever,” he wrote to his
friend, Strahan, in the year 1772, “if you saw my new house and
situation in St. Andrew’s Square.”<a name="FNanchor_329_330" id="FNanchor_329_330"></a><a href="#Footnote_329_330" class="fnanchor">[329]</a> Adam Smith told Rogers the
poet, who visited Edinburgh in 1789, that the Old Town had
given Scotland a bad name, and that he was anxious to move with
the rest.<a name="FNanchor_330_331" id="FNanchor_330_331"></a><a href="#Footnote_330_331" class="fnanchor">[330]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “EDINBURGH FLY”.</div>

<p>The age which I am attempting to describe was looked upon
by Lord Cockburn as “the last purely Scotch age that Scotland
was destined to see. The whole country had not begun to be
absorbed in the ocean of London.”<a name="FNanchor_331_332" id="FNanchor_331_332"></a><a href="#Footnote_331_332" class="fnanchor">[331]</a> The distance between the
two capitals as measured by time, fatigue, and money was little
less than the distance in the present day between Liverpool and
New York. Johnson, who travelled in post-chaises, and therefore
in great comfort, was nine days on the road. “He purposed,” he
wrote, “not to loiter much by the way;”<a name="FNanchor_332_333" id="FNanchor_332_333"></a><a href="#Footnote_332_333" class="fnanchor">[332]</a> but he did not journey
by night, and he indulged in two days’ rest at Newcastle. Hume,
three years later, travelling by easy stages on account of his failing
health, took two days longer.<a name="FNanchor_333_334" id="FNanchor_333_334"></a><a href="#Footnote_333_334" class="fnanchor">[333]</a> Had Johnson gone by the public
conveyance, the “Newcastle Fly” would have brought him in three
days as far as that town at a charge of £3 6<abbr title="shilling">s.</abbr> On the panels of the
“Fly” was painted the motto, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sat cito si sat bene</i>. Thence he would
have continued his journey by the “Edinburgh Fly,” which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_60" id="Page_60">{60}</a></span>
traversed the whole remaining distance in a single day in summer,
and in a day and a half in winter. The charge for this was £1 11<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr>
In these sums were not included the payments to the drivers and
guards. The “Newcastle Fly” ran six times a week, starting from
London an hour after midnight. The “Edinburgh Fly” ran only
on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays. A traveller then who
lost no time on the road, leaving London at one o’clock on Sunday
night, would in the summer-time reach Edinburgh by Thursday
evening, and in the winter after mid-day on Friday.<a name="FNanchor_334_335" id="FNanchor_334_335"></a><a href="#Footnote_334_335" class="fnanchor">[334]</a> Even the
mail which was carried on horse-back, and went five times a week,
took in good weather about 82 hours.<a name="FNanchor_335_336" id="FNanchor_335_336"></a><a href="#Footnote_335_336" class="fnanchor">[335]</a> The news of the battle of
Culloden, though it was forwarded by an express, was seven days
all but two or three hours in reaching London.<a name="FNanchor_336_337" id="FNanchor_336_337"></a><a href="#Footnote_336_337" class="fnanchor">[336]</a> There were men
living in 1824 who recollected when the mail came down with only
one single letter for Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_337_338" id="FNanchor_337_338"></a><a href="#Footnote_337_338" class="fnanchor">[337]</a> By 1793 a great acceleration
had been effected in the coach-service. It was possible, so the proud
boast ran, to leave Edinburgh after morning service on Sunday,
spend a whole day in London, and be back again by six o’clock on
Saturday morning.<a name="FNanchor_338_339" id="FNanchor_338_339"></a><a href="#Footnote_338_339" class="fnanchor">[338]</a> The weary traveller would have had to pass
every night in the coach. By the year 1800 the journey was done
from London to Edinburgh in fifty-eight hours, and from Edinburgh
to London in sixty and a half.<a name="FNanchor_339_340" id="FNanchor_339_340"></a><a href="#Footnote_339_340" class="fnanchor">[339]</a> But such annihilation of
time and space, as no doubt this rapid rate of travelling was then
called, was not dreamed of in Johnson’s day. The capitals of
England and Scotland still stood widely apart. It was wholly “a
Scotch scene” which the English traveller saw, and “independent
tastes and ideas and pursuits” caught his attention.<a name="FNanchor_340_341" id="FNanchor_340_341"></a><a href="#Footnote_340_341" class="fnanchor">[340]</a> Nevertheless
in one respect Edinburgh, as I have already said, felt strongly
the influence of England. In its literature and its language it was
laboriously forming itself on the English model. There had been
a long period during which neither learning nor literature had
shone in Scotland with any brightness of light. Since the days
of the great classical scholars not a single famous author had been
seen. There had been “farthing candles” from time to time, but
no “northern lights.”<a name="FNanchor_341_342" id="FNanchor_341_342"></a><a href="#Footnote_341_342" class="fnanchor">[341]</a> The two countries were under the same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">{61}</a></span>
sovereign, but there was no Age of Queen Anne north of the
Tweed. There was indeed that general diffusion of learning which
was conspicuously wanting in England. An English traveller
noticed with surprise how rare it was to find “a man of any rank
but the lowest who had not some tincture of learning. It was the
pride and delight of every father to give his son a liberal education.”<a name="FNanchor_342_343" id="FNanchor_342_343"></a><a href="#Footnote_342_343" class="fnanchor">[342]</a>
Nevertheless it had been “with their learning as with
provisions in a besieged town, every man had a mouthful and no
one a bellyful.”<a name="FNanchor_343_344" id="FNanchor_343_344"></a><a href="#Footnote_343_344" class="fnanchor">[343]</a> That there was a foundation for Johnson’s pointed
saying was many years later candidly admitted by Sir Walter
Scott.<a name="FNanchor_344_345" id="FNanchor_344_345"></a><a href="#Footnote_344_345" class="fnanchor">[344]</a> So great had been the dearth of literature that the
printer’s art had fallen into decay. About the year 1740 there
were but four printing-houses in Edinburgh, which found scanty
employment in producing school-books, law-papers, newspapers,
sermons, and Bibles. By 1779 the number had risen from four to
seven and twenty.<a name="FNanchor_345_346" id="FNanchor_345_346"></a><a href="#Footnote_345_346" class="fnanchor">[345]</a> This rapid growth was by no means wholly
due to an increase in Scotch authors. Edinburgh might have
become “a hot-bed of genius,” but such productiveness even in a
hot-bed would have been unparalleled. The booksellers in late
years, in defiance of the supposed law of copyright, had begun to
reprint the works of standard English writers, and after a long
litigation had been confirmed in what they were doing by a
decision given in the House of Lords.<a name="FNanchor_346_347" id="FNanchor_346_347"></a><a href="#Footnote_346_347" class="fnanchor">[346]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH STUDIED BY THE SCOTCH.</div>

<p>The growth of literature in Scotland had taken a turn which
was not unnatural. In the troubles of the seventeenth century the
nation, while yet it was in its power, had neglected to refine its
language. No great masters of style had risen. There had been
no Sir William Temple “to give cadence to its prose.”<a name="FNanchor_347_348" id="FNanchor_347_348"></a><a href="#Footnote_347_348" class="fnanchor">[347]</a> The
settled government and the freedom from tyranny which the
country enjoyed on the fall of the Stuarts, the growth of material
wealth which followed on the Union, the gradual diminution of
bigotry and the scattering of darkness which was part of the general
enlightenment of Europe had given birth to a love of modern literature.
The old classical learning no longer sufficed. Having no
literature of their own which satisfied their aspirations, the younger
generation of men was forced to acquire the language of their<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">{62}</a></span>
ancient rivals, brought as it had been by a long succession of
illustrious authors to a high degree of perfection.<a name="FNanchor_348_349" id="FNanchor_348_349"></a><a href="#Footnote_348_349" class="fnanchor">[348]</a> It was to the
volumes of Addison that the Scotch student was henceforth to give
his days and nights. To read English was an art soon acquired,
but to write it, and still more to speak it correctly, demanded a
long and laborious study. Very few, with all their perseverance,
succeeded like Mallet in “clearing their tongues from their native
pronunciation.”<a name="FNanchor_349_350" id="FNanchor_349_350"></a><a href="#Footnote_349_350" class="fnanchor">[349]</a> Even to understand the language when spoken
was only got by practice. A young lady from the country, who
was reproached with having seen on the Edinburgh stage some
loose play, artlessly replied:&mdash;“Indeed they did nothing wrong
that I saw; and as for what they said, it was high English, and I
did not understand it.”<a name="FNanchor_350_351" id="FNanchor_350_351"></a><a href="#Footnote_350_351" class="fnanchor">[350]</a> Dr. Beattie studied English from books
like a dead language. To write it correctly cost him years of
labour.<a name="FNanchor_351_352" id="FNanchor_351_352"></a><a href="#Footnote_351_352" class="fnanchor">[351]</a> “The conversation of the Edinburgh authors,” said
Topham, “showed that they wrote English as a foreign tongue,”
for their spoken language was so unlike their written.<a name="FNanchor_352_353" id="FNanchor_352_353"></a><a href="#Footnote_352_353" class="fnanchor">[352]</a> Some men
were as careless of their accent as they were careful of their words.
Hume’s tone was always broad Scotch, but Scotch words he carefully
avoided.<a name="FNanchor_353_354" id="FNanchor_353_354"></a><a href="#Footnote_353_354" class="fnanchor">[353]</a> Others indulged in two styles and two accents,
one for familiar life, the other for the pulpit, the court of Session,
or the professor’s chair. In all this there was a great and a strange
variety. Lord Kames, for instance, in his social hour spoke pure
Scotch, though “with a tone not displeasing from its vulgarity;”
on the Bench his language approached to English.<a name="FNanchor_354_355" id="FNanchor_354_355"></a><a href="#Footnote_354_355" class="fnanchor">[354]</a> His brother
judge, Lord Auchinleck, on the other hand, clung to his mother
tongue. He would not smooth or round his periods, or give up
his broad Scotch, however vulgar it was accounted. The sturdy
old fellow felt, no doubt, a contempt for that “compound of affectation
and pomposity” which some of his countrymen spoke&mdash;a
language which “no Englishman could understand.”<a name="FNanchor_355_356" id="FNanchor_355_356"></a><a href="#Footnote_355_356" class="fnanchor">[355]</a> In their
attempt to get rid of their accent they too often arrived at the
young lady’s <em>High English</em>, a mode of speaking far enough removed
no doubt from the Scotch, but such as “made ‘the fools who used
it’ truly ridiculous.”<a name="FNanchor_356_357" id="FNanchor_356_357"></a><a href="#Footnote_356_357" class="fnanchor">[356]</a> There were others who were far more successful.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">{63}</a></span>
“The conversation of the Scots,” wrote Johnson, “grows
every day less unpleasing to the English; their peculiarities wear
fast away; their dialect is likely to become in half a century provincial
and rustic, even to themselves. The great, the learned, the
ambitious, and the vain, all cultivate the English phrase, and the
English pronunciation; and in splendid companies Scotch is not
much heard, except now and then from an old lady.”<a name="FNanchor_357_358" id="FNanchor_357_358"></a><a href="#Footnote_357_358" class="fnanchor">[357]</a> The old
lady whom he chiefly had in his memory when he wrote this was
probably the Duchess of Douglas. He had met her at Boswell’s
table. “She talks broad Scotch with a paralytick voice,” he wrote
to Mrs. Thrale, “and is scarce understood by her own countrymen.”<a name="FNanchor_358_359" id="FNanchor_358_359"></a><a href="#Footnote_358_359" class="fnanchor">[358]</a>
Boswell himself, by the instruction of a player from Drury Lane,
who had brought a company to Edinburgh, succeeded so well in
clearing his tongue of his Scotch that Johnson complimented him
by saying: “Sir, your pronunciation is not offensive.”<a name="FNanchor_359_360" id="FNanchor_359_360"></a><a href="#Footnote_359_360" class="fnanchor">[359]</a></p>

<p>In their pursuit of English literature the Scotch proved as
successful as in everything else which they took in hand. Whatever
ill-will may have existed between the two nations, there was no
grudging admiration shown in England for their authors. In
popularity few writers of their time surpassed Thomson, Smollett,
Hume, Robertson, John Home, Macpherson, Hugh Blair, Beattie,
and Boswell; neither had Robert Blair, Mallet, Kames, John
Dalrymple, Henry Mackenzie, Monboddo, Adam Ferguson, and
Watson, any reason to complain of neglect. If Adam Smith and
Reid were not so popular as some of their contemporaries it was
because they had written for the small class of thinkers; though
the <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>, which was published little more than two
years after Johnson’s visit, was by the end of the century to reach
its ninth edition. “This, I believe, is the historical age, and this
the historical nation,” Hume wrote proudly from Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_360_361" id="FNanchor_360_361"></a><a href="#Footnote_360_361" class="fnanchor">[360]</a> He
boasted that “the copy-money” given him for his <cite>History</cite> “much
exceeded anything formerly known in England.” It made him
“not only independent but opulent.” Robertson for his <cite>Charles V.</cite>
received £3,400, and £400 was to be added on the publication of
the second edition.<a name="FNanchor_361_362" id="FNanchor_361_362"></a><a href="#Footnote_361_362" class="fnanchor">[361]</a> Blair for a single volume of his Sermons was
paid £600.<a name="FNanchor_362_363" id="FNanchor_362_363"></a><a href="#Footnote_362_363" class="fnanchor">[362]</a></p>

<p>Whatever ardour Scotchmen showed for English literature as<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">{64}</a></span>
men of letters, yet they never for one moment forgot their pride in
their own country. In a famous club they had banded themselves
together for the sake of doing away with a reproach which had
been cast upon their nation. Just as down to the present time no
Parliament has ventured to trust Ireland with a single regiment of
volunteers, so Scotland one hundred years ago was not trusted with
a militia. In the words of Burns,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Her lost militia fired her bluid.”<a name="FNanchor_363_364" id="FNanchor_363_364"></a><a href="#Footnote_363_364" class="fnanchor">[363]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE POKER CLUB.</div>

<p>In 1759 a Bill for establishing this force had been brought into
Parliament, and though Pitt acquiesced in the measure, it was
thrown out by “the young Whigs.” Most Englishmen probably
felt with Horace Walpole, when he rejoiced that “the disaffected
in Scotland could not obtain this mode of having their arms
restored.”<a name="FNanchor_364_365" id="FNanchor_364_365"></a><a href="#Footnote_364_365" class="fnanchor">[364]</a> Two or three years later the literary men in Edinburgh,
affronted by this refusal, formed themselves into a league of patriots.
The name of The Militia Club, which they had at first thought of
adopting, was rejected as too directly offensive. With a happy
allusion to the part which they were to play in stirring up the fire
and spirit of the country, they decided on calling themselves “The
Poker.” Andrew Crosbie, the original of Mr. Counsellor Pleydell,
was humorously elected Assassin, and David Hume was added as
his Assessor, “without whose assent nothing should be done.”<a name="FNanchor_365_366" id="FNanchor_365_366"></a><a href="#Footnote_365_366" class="fnanchor">[365]</a> It
was urged with great force that Scotland was as much exposed as
England to plunder and invasion. Why, it was asked, was she
refused a militia when one had been granted to Cumberland and
Westmoreland, and Lancashire? Had not those countries contributed
more adventurers to the forces of the Young Pretender
than all the Lowlands? “Why put a sword in the hands of
foreigners for wounding the Scottish nation and name? A name
admired at home for fidelity, regaled [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] in every clime for strictness
of discipline, and dreaded for intrepidity.”<a name="FNanchor_366_367" id="FNanchor_366_367"></a><a href="#Footnote_366_367" class="fnanchor">[366]</a> In 1776 the Bill
was a second time brought in, but was a second time rejected. “I
am glad,” said Johnson, “that the Parliament has had the spirit to
throw it out.”<a name="FNanchor_367_368" id="FNanchor_367_368"></a><a href="#Footnote_367_368" class="fnanchor">[367]</a> By this time it was not timidity only which caused
the rejection. The English were touched in their pockets. It was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
maintained that as Scotland contributed so little to the land-tax, so
if she needed a militia she ought to bear the whole expense herself.
“What enemy,” asked Johnson scornfully, “would invade Scotland
where there is nothing to be got?”<a name="FNanchor_368_369" id="FNanchor_368_369"></a><a href="#Footnote_368_369" class="fnanchor">[368]</a> It was not till the year 1793,
in the midst of the alarms of a war with France, that the force was
at last established, and Scotland in one more respect placed on an
equality with England.</p>

<p>In Edinburgh such a club as this, formed of all the eager active
spirits in the place, could act with the greater vigour from the ease
with which the members could meet. In whatever quarter of the
town men lived, even if they had moved to the squares which had
lately been built to the north and south, they were not much more
widely separated than the residents in the Colleges of Oxford. The
narrowness of the limits in which they were confined is shown by
the small number of hackney-coaches which served their wants. In
London, in 1761, there were eight hundred; by 1784 they had
risen to a thousand.<a name="FNanchor_369_370" id="FNanchor_369_370"></a><a href="#Footnote_369_370" class="fnanchor">[369]</a> In Edinburgh there were but nine; and even
these, it was complained, were rarely to be seen on the stand after
three o’clock in the afternoon. It was in sedan chairs that visits of
ceremony were paid; the bearers were Highlanders, as in London
they were generally Irishmen.<a name="FNanchor_370_371" id="FNanchor_370_371"></a><a href="#Footnote_370_371" class="fnanchor">[370]</a> The dinner-hour was still so early
that the meal of careless and cheerful hospitality was the supper.
In 1763 fashionable people dined at two; twenty years later at four
or even at five.<a name="FNanchor_371_372" id="FNanchor_371_372"></a><a href="#Footnote_371_372" class="fnanchor">[371]</a> At the time of Johnson’s visit three was probably
the common hour. Dr. Carlyle describes the ease with which in
his younger days a pleasant supper party was gathered together.
“We dined where we best could, and by cadies<a name="FNanchor_372_373" id="FNanchor_372_373"></a><a href="#Footnote_372_373" class="fnanchor">[372]</a> we assembled our
friends to meet us in a tavern by nine o’clock; and a fine time it was
when we could collect David Hume, Adam Smith, Adam Ferguson,
Lord Elibank, and Drs. Blair and Jardine on an hour’s warning.”<a name="FNanchor_373_374" id="FNanchor_373_374"></a><a href="#Footnote_373_374" class="fnanchor">[373]</a>
Though the Scotch were “religious observers of hospitality,”<a name="FNanchor_374_375" id="FNanchor_374_375"></a><a href="#Footnote_374_375" class="fnanchor">[374]</a> yet
a stranger did not readily get invited to their favourite meal. “To
be admitted to their suppers is a mark of their friendship. At them
the restraints of ceremony are banished, and you see people really
as they are.” The Scotch ladies, it was noticed, at these cheerful
but prolonged repasts drank more wine than an English woman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">{66}</a></span>
could well bear, “but the climate required it.”<a name="FNanchor_375_376" id="FNanchor_375_376"></a><a href="#Footnote_375_376" class="fnanchor">[375]</a> The “patriotic
Knox” describes the inhabitants of Edinburgh as being “not only
courteous, obliging, open, and hospitable, but well-inclined to
the bottle.” It was not to the climate that he attributed this joyous
devotion, but “to their social dispositions and the excellence of
their wines.”<a name="FNanchor_376_377" id="FNanchor_376_377"></a><a href="#Footnote_376_377" class="fnanchor">[376]</a> Boswell has left us a description of a supper which
he enjoyed at Hume’s new house in St. Andrew’s Square. He had
Dr. Robertson and Lord Kames for his fellow-guests, and three
sorts of ice-creams among the dishes. “What think you of the
northern Epicurus style?” he asked. He complained, however,
that he could recollect no conversation. “Our writers here are
really not prompt on all occasions as those of London.”<a name="FNanchor_377_378" id="FNanchor_377_378"></a><a href="#Footnote_377_378" class="fnanchor">[377]</a> He had
been spoilt by the talk in the taverns of Fleet Street and the Turk’s
Head Club, and was discontented because he did not find in St.
Andrew’s Square a Johnson, a Burke, a Wilkes, and a Beauclerk.</p>

<div class="sidenote">JOHNSON AND DAVID HUME.</div>

<p>Into Hume’s pleasant house Johnson unhappily never entered.<a name="FNanchor_378_379" id="FNanchor_378_379"></a><a href="#Footnote_378_379" class="fnanchor">[378]</a>
He even thought that his friend Dr. Adams, the Master of Pembroke
College, had done wrong when he had met by invitation
“that infidel writer” at dinner, and “had treated him with smooth
civility.”<a name="FNanchor_379_380" id="FNanchor_379_380"></a><a href="#Footnote_379_380" class="fnanchor">[379]</a> Yet a man who could yield to the temptation of the talk
of Jack Wilkes had no right to stand aloof from David Hume. We
should like to know what he would have thought of that philosopher’s
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">soupe à la reine</i> made from a receipt which he had copied in his own
neat hand, or of his “beef and cabbage (a charming dish) and
old mutton and old claret, in which,” he boasted, “no man excelled
him.” Perhaps, however, if Johnson could have been persuaded to
taste the claret, old as it was, he would have shaken his head over
it and called it “poor stuff.”<a name="FNanchor_380_381" id="FNanchor_380_381"></a><a href="#Footnote_380_381" class="fnanchor">[380]</a> The sheep-head broth he would
certainly have refused, though one Mr. Keith did speak of it
for eight days after,<a name="FNanchor_381_382" id="FNanchor_381_382"></a><a href="#Footnote_381_382" class="fnanchor">[381]</a> and the Duke de Nivernois would have bound
himself apprentice to Hume’s lass to learn it.<a name="FNanchor_382_383" id="FNanchor_382_383"></a><a href="#Footnote_382_383" class="fnanchor">[382]</a> “The stye of that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
fattest of Epicurus’s hogs” he failed to visit. “You tell me,” wrote
the great Gibbon to a friend who was at Edinburgh just at the time
of Johnson’s arrival, “you tell me of a long list of Dukes, Lords,
and Chieftains of renown to whom you are introduced; were I with
you I should prefer one <em>David</em> to them all.”<a name="FNanchor_383_384" id="FNanchor_383_384"></a><a href="#Footnote_383_384" class="fnanchor">[383]</a> Boswell could easily
have brought the two men together, intimate as he was with both.
Early in his life he was able to boast that one of them had visited
him in the forenoon and the other in the afternoon of the same day.<a name="FNanchor_384_385" id="FNanchor_384_385"></a><a href="#Footnote_384_385" class="fnanchor">[384]</a>
Hume’s conversation perhaps was not after the fashion which
Johnson liked. It certainly would not have come recommended to
him by his broad Scotch accent. Nevertheless there was that about
it which endeared it to his friends. For innocent mirth and
agreeable raillery he was thought to be unmatched.<a name="FNanchor_385_386" id="FNanchor_385_386"></a><a href="#Footnote_385_386" class="fnanchor">[385]</a> Adam Smith
has celebrated his constant pleasantry. In his wit there was not
the slightest tincture of malignity.<a name="FNanchor_386_387" id="FNanchor_386_387"></a><a href="#Footnote_386_387" class="fnanchor">[386]</a> But Johnson would have
nothing to do with him.<a name="FNanchor_387_388" id="FNanchor_387_388"></a><a href="#Footnote_387_388" class="fnanchor">[387]</a> In Boswell’s house in James’s Court,
that Sunday he spent there in Dr. Robertson’s company, he said
“something much too rough both as to Mr. Hume’s head and
heart,” which Boswell thought well to suppress. In the quiet stillness
of that summer sabbath day in Edinburgh, the strong loud
voice might almost have been carried across the narrow valley
to St. Andrew’s Square, and startled the philosopher in his retirement.</p>

<p>Neither did Johnson see Adam Smith, who in Hume’s house
had his room whenever he chose to occupy it. To meet a famous
stranger he would, we may well believe, have willingly crossed the
Firth from his house in Kirkaldy. But the two men had once met
in London, and “we did not take to each other,” said Johnson.
Had he been more tolerant, and sought the society of these two
great Scotchmen, he would have seen in Scotland the best which
Scotland had to show. Even as it was, in his visit to the capital
and the seats of the other universities, in his tour through Lowlands,
Highlands and Isles, he saw perhaps as great a variety of men and
manners as had been seen in that country by any Englishman up to
his time.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BEGINNING OF THE TOUR.</div>

<p>On Friday, August 6th, 1773, Dr. Johnson set off from London
on his famous tour to the Western Islands of Scotland. His
companion as far as Newcastle was Robert Chambers, Principal of
New Inn Hall, Oxford, who had been lately appointed one of the
new judges for India, and was going down to his native town to
take leave of his family. The two friends travelled in a post-chaise.
“Life has not many better things than this,” said Johnson
once when he was driven rapidly along in one with Boswell.<a name="FNanchor_388_389" id="FNanchor_388_389"></a><a href="#Footnote_388_389" class="fnanchor">[388]</a> It
was too costly a pleasure for him to indulge in often unless he
could find a companion to share the expense. The charge for a
chaise and pair of horses for two passengers from London to
Edinburgh could scarcely have been kept under twenty-two
pounds.<a name="FNanchor_389_390" id="FNanchor_389_390"></a><a href="#Footnote_389_390" class="fnanchor">[389]</a> The weather was bright and hot.<a name="FNanchor_390_391" id="FNanchor_390_391"></a><a href="#Footnote_390_391" class="fnanchor">[390]</a> At Newcastle
Chambers’s place in the chaise was taken by a fellow-townsman
who was destined to go far beyond him in the career of the law&mdash;William
Scott, afterwards Lord Stowell, the great judge of the
High Court of Admiralty. The travellers entered Scotland by
Berwick-on-Tweed, passing near to those nine wells which gave
their name to the estate which had come down to David Hume’s
father through many generations. Very likely they dined at
Dunbar, that “high and windy town,” and thought, as they crossed
the Brocksburn, how Cromwell’s horse and foot charged across it
in the mingled light of the harvest-moon and the early dawn on
that September morning one hundred and twenty-three years before.
Their next stage would bring them to Haddington, past the ruined
Abbey where nearly a hundred years later that great Scotchman,
Johnson’s foremost champion, was often with a contrite and almost
broken heart to seek his wife’s grave in the desolate chancel. As
they drove on they passed by the wide plain, shut in by the sea on
one side and by a morass on the other, over which, only twenty-eight<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
years earlier, on another misty morning in September, the rude
Highlanders had chased Cope’s English Dragoons in shameful
and headlong flight. Evening had overtaken the travellers by this
time, so that they could not have seen “the one solitary thorn bush
round which lay the greatest number of slain,” or the grey tower
of the church of Preston Pans, whence the afternoon before the
battle, young Alexander Carlyle had looked down upon the two
armies.<a name="FNanchor_391_392" id="FNanchor_391_392"></a><a href="#Footnote_391_392" class="fnanchor">[391]</a> They passed Pinkie, where the Protector Somerset’s
soldiers had made such a savage massacre of the routed Scotch;
and Carberry Hill, where Mary took her last farewell of Bothwell
as she gave herself up to the Scottish lords. They passed, too, the
serfs of Tranent and Preston Pans, “the colliers and salters who
were in a state of slavery and bondage, bound to the collieries or
salt-works for life.”<a name="FNanchor_392_393" id="FNanchor_392_393"></a><a href="#Footnote_392_393" class="fnanchor">[392]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROAD TO EDINBURGH.</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE WHITE HORSE INN.</div>

<p>Entering Edinburgh by the road which goes near Holyrood
House, and driving along the Canongate, they alighted at the
entrance to White Horse Close, at the end of which stood the
White Horse Inn. The sign, the crest of the house of Hanover,
had probably been adopted on the accession of George I., and
was a proof of loyalty to the reigning family. In London in
the year 1761 there were forty-nine alleys, lanes and yards which
were so called.<a name="FNanchor_393_394" id="FNanchor_393_394"></a><a href="#Footnote_393_394" class="fnanchor">[393]</a> It was, however, said that the name had been
given as a memorial of a white horse which, by winning a
race on Leith Sands, had saved its master, the inn-keeper, from
ruin.<a name="FNanchor_394_395" id="FNanchor_394_395"></a><a href="#Footnote_394_395" class="fnanchor">[394]</a> According to the Scotch custom the inn was generally
known not by its sign, but by the name of its landlord.<a name="FNanchor_395_396" id="FNanchor_395_396"></a><a href="#Footnote_395_396" class="fnanchor">[395]</a> Thus
Boswell calls this house Boyd’s Inn. In the <cite>Edinburgh Directory</cite>
for 1773-4 we find under the letter B, at the head of the <em>Stablers</em>,
“Boyd, James, canongate head.” In the present time, when an inn,
however small, assumes the dignified title of <em>Hotel</em>, we may admire
the modesty of these Edinburgh innkeepers, not one of whom,
pretended to be anything more than a stabler. In fact they
scarcely deserved any higher name; their houses were on a level<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
with the inn at Rochester where the two carriers in Falstaff’s time
passed so restless a night. A traveller who had stayed in this house
a year or two before Johnson’s visit, described it as being “crowded
and confused. The master lives in the stable, the mistress is not
equal to the business. You must not expect breakfast before nine
o’clock, and you must think yourself happy if you do not find every
room fresh mopped.”<a name="FNanchor_396_397" id="FNanchor_396_397"></a><a href="#Footnote_396_397" class="fnanchor">[396]</a> The date of 1683 inscribed upon the large
window above the outside steps,<a name="FNanchor_397_398" id="FNanchor_397_398"></a><a href="#Footnote_397_398" class="fnanchor">[397]</a> showed that even in Johnson’s
time it was an old house. For the whole of the eighteenth century
it was one of the chief starting places for the stage-coaches. It
sank later on into a carrier’s inn, says Sir Walter Scott, “and has
since been held unworthy even of that occupation. It was a base
hovel.”<a name="FNanchor_398_399" id="FNanchor_398_399"></a><a href="#Footnote_398_399" class="fnanchor">[398]</a> Yet James Boyd, who kept it, retired with a fortune<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_71" id="Page_71">{71}</a></span>
of several thousand pounds. That he possessed napery to the value
of five hundred pounds is stated by Chambers to be a well-authenticated
fact. “A large room in the house was the frequent scene of
the marriages of runaway English couples. On one of the windows
were scratched the words:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>‘Jeremiah and Sarah Bentham, 1768.’”<a name="FNanchor_399_400" id="FNanchor_399_400"></a><a href="#Footnote_399_400" class="fnanchor">[399]</a></p></div>

<p>It was from this miserable inn that Johnson, on August 14th,
sent the following note to Boswell’s house:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Johnson sends his compliments to Mr. Boswell, being just arrived at
Boyd’s.</p>

<p>“Saturday night.”</p></div>

<p>Boswell went to him directly, and learnt from Scott that “the
Doctor had unluckily had a bad specimen of Scottish cleanliness.
He then drank no fermented liquor. He asked to have his
lemonade made sweeter; upon which the waiter, with his greasy
fingers, lifted a lump of sugar, and put it into it. The Doctor, in
indignation, threw it out of the window. Scott said he was afraid
that he would have knocked the waiter down.” Boswell at once
carried off Johnson to his own house. Scott he left behind with
the sincere regret that he had not also a room for him. Could the
future eminence of the great judge have been foreseen, or had his
“amiable manners” been generally known, surely some one would
have been found eager to welcome him as a guest and rescue him
from the Canongate Stabler. “He was one of the pleasantest men
I ever knew,” wrote Sir Walter Scott, fifty-five years later, when
he met him at a dinner at Richmond Park, “looking very frail and
even comatose.”<a name="FNanchor_400_401" id="FNanchor_400_401"></a><a href="#Footnote_400_401" class="fnanchor">[400]</a> He lived some while longer, and did not die
till the memory of this jaunt, and of everything else had been lost
in the forgetfulness in which his mind sank beneath the burthen of
fourscore years and ten.<a name="FNanchor_401_402" id="FNanchor_401_402"></a><a href="#Footnote_401_402" class="fnanchor">[401]</a> Let us hope that on his first visit to
Edinburgh, like Matthew Bramble, “he got decent lodgings in the
house of a widow gentlewoman.”<a name="FNanchor_402_403" id="FNanchor_402_403"></a><a href="#Footnote_402_403" class="fnanchor">[402]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_72" id="Page_72">{72}</a></span></p>

<p>The old inn still stands, a picturesque ruin and an interesting
memorial of the discomfort of a long race of wandering strangers.
No one here ever repeated with emotion, either great or small,
Shenstone’s lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Whoe’er has travelled life’s dull round,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Where’er his stages may have been,</div>
<div class="verse">May sigh to think he still has found</div>
<div class="verse indent2">The warmest welcome at an inn.”<a name="FNanchor_403_404" id="FNanchor_403_404"></a><a href="#Footnote_403_404" class="fnanchor">[403]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>With a little care it could have been made a place where “a man
might take his ease in his inn,” for it stood aloof from the noise of
the street, was well-built and was sufficiently roomy. An outside
stone staircase, which after a few steps turned right and left, led up
to the first floor, where doubtless, according to the common Scotch
custom, the principal rooms were placed. With its turrets and its
gables it must have looked pleasant enough to the young runaway
couples as they hurried in from the Canongate, and passed the outside
staircases and open galleries of the houses on each side of the
Close, and so went up to the large room where many a name was
scratched with a diamond ring on the pane. “And they are gone,”
gone like the lovers of St. Agnes’ Eve.<a name="FNanchor_404_405" id="FNanchor_404_405"></a><a href="#Footnote_404_405" class="fnanchor">[404]</a></p>

<h2 class="p2"><a name="Jamess_Court" id="Jamess_Court"><span class="smcap">James’s Court.</span></a></h2>

<div class="sidenote">JAMES’S COURT.</div>

<p>“Boswell,” wrote Johnson to Mrs. Thrale, “has very handsome
and spacious rooms; level with the ground on one side of the
house, and on the other four stories high.” At this time he was
living in James’s Court, on the northern side of the Lawnmarket,
having lately removed from Chessel’s Buildings in the Canongate.
It is not easy for the stranger who passes from the thronged street
under the low archway into that quiet, but gloomy, and even
shabby-looking court, to picture to himself the gay and lively
company which once frequented it. Now ragged, bare-footed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_73" id="Page_73">{73}</a></span>
children are playing about; in some of the windows there are broken
and patched panes of glass, while high above one’s head, from the
different storeys, are
hanging out to dry
garments of various
sorts and hues, on a
curious kind of framework,
let down by a
pulley and string, till
it stands out square
from the wall. Some
of the houses are
coloured with a yellow
wash, in others
the stones round the
windows and at the
corners are painted
red. The uncoloured
stone is a grey darkened
by years of
smoke. The lower
windows are guarded
by iron gratings. On
the southern, or Lawnmarket
side, a block of
building juts out, and
makes a division in
the Court. This projection
looks as ancient
as any part, and
was doubtless there in
those old days when
the place was inhabited
by a select set
of gentlemen, “who
kept a clerk to record
their names and proceedings, had a scavenger of their own, clubbed
in many public measures, and had balls and assemblies among themselves.”<a name="FNanchor_405_406" id="FNanchor_405_406"></a><a href="#Footnote_405_406" class="fnanchor">[405]</a>
It must have pleasantly recalled to Boswell the chambers<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_74" id="Page_74">{74}</a></span>
which had been lent him in the Temple that summer in which he
first became acquainted with Johnson, for it, too, was a nest of
lawyers. There were inhabiting it at this time thirteen advocates,
among them Lord Elibank, seven Writers to the Signet and Clerks
of Session, a Commissioner, and two first clerks of advocates. The
other householders were only six in number: two physicians, one of
whom was Sir John Pringle,<a name="FNanchor_406_407" id="FNanchor_406_407"></a><a href="#Footnote_406_407" class="fnanchor">[406]</a> the President of the Royal Society of
London, a teller in the Old Bank, a teacher of French, a dancing-mistress,
and a gentlewoman. Pringle, who was Boswell’s intimate
friend, was one of “the three topics” which he begged Johnson to
avoid at his father’s house&mdash;Presbyterianism and Whiggism being
the other two. If any one of these subjects were introduced an
altercation was certain to follow, for all three were as dear to Lord
Auchinleck as they were distasteful to Johnson. Here Hume had
lived till very lately in a house “which was very cheerful and even
elegant, but was too small,” he complained, “to display his great
talents for cookery.” Nevertheless it had been the one spot to
which, when abroad, his heart untravelled had fondly turned.
Even in the palace at Fontainebleau, while fresh from the flattery
of the three young princes who were in turn to be kings of France,
in this high tide of his fortune it was for “his easy-chair and his
retreat in James’s Court that twice or thrice a day” he longed.
Here he had welcomed Benjamin Franklin, here Adam Smith had
been his frequent guest, and here he had offered a shelter to
Rousseau. In his absence from Edinburgh Dr. Blair had been
his tenant, and here, no doubt, had written some of those sermons
and lectures which were to attain so wide a popularity, and then
to sink into as deep a neglect. The time once was when Blair’s
shrine would have drawn a crowd of pilgrims.</p>

<p>Hume and Boswell had for a short time been very near neighbours,
as it was in the same block of buildings<a name="FNanchor_407_408" id="FNanchor_407_408"></a><a href="#Footnote_407_408" class="fnanchor">[407]</a> that they lived.
If the elder man had entertained the American patriot, Franklin,
the younger had entertained the Corsican patriot, Pascal Paoli.
He could boast, moreover, of the distinguished guests who thronged
his house during Johnson’s two visits, both at his first coming and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_75" id="Page_75">{75}</a></span>
on his return from the Hebrides. Judges, and advocates who
were destined one day to sit on the bench, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief,
men and women of high birth, authors, divines, physicians,
all came to see and hear the famous Englishman. We can picture
to ourselves the sedan-chairs passing in under the low gateway,
bearing the fine ladies and gentlemen who came to attend “the
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">levée</i> which he held from ten o’clock in the morning till one or two.”
The echo of the strong loud voice with the slow deliberate
utterance still almost seems to sound in our ears as we wander
about in this dreary spot. “I could not attend him,” writes
Boswell, “being obliged to be in the Court of Session; but my
wife was so good as to devote the greater part of the morning to
the endless task of pouring out tea for my friend and his visitors.”</p>

<p>More than one caller, as he gazed on the huge frame, the
scarred face, and the awkward strange movements of the man of
whom they had heard so much, might have exclaimed with Lord
Elibank, that “hardly anything seemed more improbable than to
see Dr. Johnson in Scotland.” What Edinburgh said and thought
of him we should greatly like to know. But no letters recording
his visit seem to be extant. Even the very house has disappeared.
Time, which has spared everything else in this old Court, has not
spared it. More than thirty years ago it was burnt to the ground.
We should have liked to wander about the rooms, and wonder
which was the bedchamber that Mrs. Boswell, “to show all respect
to the Sage,” so politely resigned to him; and where it was that
Veronica, that precocious babe of four months, by wishing “to be
held close to him, gave a proof from simple nature that his figure
was not horrid.” Where, we should have asked, was the dinner
given him at which Mrs. Boswell did her best “to aid wisdom
and wit by administering agreeable sensations to the palate”?
Where, too, were the carpets spread on which he let the wax of
the candles drop, by turning them with their heads downwards
when they did not burn bright enough? In what closet did
Boswell keep his books, whence on Sunday, with pious purpose,
Johnson took down Ogden’s Sermons, and retired with them to his
own room? They did not, however, detain him long, and he soon
rejoined the company. Which was the breakfast-room where Sir
William Forbes introduced to him the blind scholar and poet,
Dr. Blacklock? “Dear Dr. Blacklock, I am glad to see you,” he
said, with a most humane complacency. “I looked on him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_76" id="Page_76">{76}</a></span>
reverence,” he wrote to Mrs. Thrale. It has all utterly passed away;
Forbes himself has been Sir Walter Scott’s “lamented Forbes”<a name="FNanchor_408_409" id="FNanchor_408_409"></a><a href="#Footnote_408_409" class="fnanchor">[408]</a>
for more than fourscore years. All has passed away; not only the talk
about Burke, and Garrick, and Hume, and Whitefield, and genius,
and witchcraft, and the comparative difficulty of verse-making and
dictionary-making; but even the very walls which might have
caught it in its echoes. Where this famous old house once stood
now stands a modern bank, contrasting but ill in its more elaborate
architecture with the severe, and even stern, simplicity of the
ancient buildings. Nevertheless we are at no loss to picture to
ourselves the home of Hume and Boswell. Their <em>land</em> occupied
one half of the northern side of the Court; the other half, which
no doubt corresponded with it in almost every respect, happily
escaped the flames. It is so solidly built that if it is spared by the
rage of fire and of modern improvement, it has little to fear from
time. Its situation, looking down as it does with its northern
front on the Mound, and the pleasant gardens in the valley below,
has kept it from sinking in public estimation so much as most of
the neighbouring buildings. It has indeed seen better days, but it
has not lost all the outward signs of respectability; its panes are
neither broken nor patched. The ground-floor, which was, we may
assume, on the same plan as Boswell’s house, is occupied by a bookbinder,<a name="FNanchor_409_410" id="FNanchor_409_410"></a><a href="#Footnote_409_410" class="fnanchor">[409]</a>
who courteously showed me all over it. There were traces
left in this busy workshop of past splendour, and I could see
how handsome and spacious the rooms had once been. In the
windows were deep recesses, where it must have been pleasant
enough on a bright summer’s day to sit in the cool shade and look
out over the heads of the elm trees waving below, across the
sparkling waters of the Forth, on the hills of Fife in the far distance.
A stone staircase, furnished with iron gates, led down from the
level of the Court to the street four storeys below, where the foundations
of this lofty pile are laid in the rock. The staircase had
its occupant, for at one of the windows a mat-maker was busy at
his trade.<a name="FNanchor_410_411" id="FNanchor_410_411"></a><a href="#Footnote_410_411" class="fnanchor">[410]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">MEMORIALS OF GREAT MEN.</div>

<p>There is no memorial to remind passers-by of the men who have
made James’s Court so famous. The stranger, as he climbs up the
Lawnmarket to the Castle, is little likely to notice the obscure<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_77" id="Page_77">{77}</a></span>
archway through which so gay and bright and learned a company
was ever passing to and fro. In the public gardens Allan Ramsay,
John Wilson and Adam Black have each their statue. Viscount
Melville’s column lifts its head in St. Andrew’s Square, far above
David Hume’s modest house, and in its inscription, in all probability,
lies. The virtues and the glories of George IV. are lavishly
commemorated. Even good Queen Charlotte is not suffered to
be forgotten. In Chambers Street the name of the founder of
<cite>Chambers’ Journal</cite> is meant to live. On the finest site in all
Edinburgh the insignificance of the fifth Duke of Buccleugh will
struggle for immortality. We look in vain for the statue of David
Hume, of Adam Smith, and of James Boswell. What street, what
square, what bridge bear their names? Where does Edinburgh
proudly boast to the stranger that she is the birth-place of the
philosopher whose name is great in the history of the world, and
of the biographer whose work has never been equalled? Where
does she make it known that to her ancient city the author of the
<cite>Wealth of Nations</cite> retired to spend the closing years of his life and
to die? If no nobler monuments can be raised, surely some bronze
tablet or graven stone might keep fresh the memory of the spot
where Adam Smith had his chamber, where Benjamin Franklin
came to visit David Hume, where Rousseau was offered a shelter,
and where James Boswell’s guests were Pascal Paoli and Samuel
Johnson.</p>

<p>It was in good company that Johnson, on the morning of
Monday, August 16, “walked out to see some of the things which
they had to show in Edinburgh,” for he was under the guidance of
the historian of Scotland. “I love Robertson,” Johnson had said
a few years earlier, “and I won’t talk of his book.” If Boswell
had reported any part of this saying we may hope that it was only
the first half, for he who neglects the author makes but a poor
recompense by loving the man. At all events, Robertson was not
troubled with diffidence, for at Holyrood “he fluently harangued”
his companion on the scenes described in his History. No doubt
he told many of those anecdotes for which Johnson that morning<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_78" id="Page_78">{78}</a></span>
had declared his love as they breakfasted together, and took care not
to attempt “to weave them into a system.” <span class="sidenote">THE LAWNMARKET.</span> As they passed into the
Lawnmarket they had not before them that wide expanse which in
the present day makes so noble an end to the High Street.
The view was obstructed by the Weigh House, the Luckenbooths,
the Tolbooth, and the Guard House.<a name="FNanchor_411_412" id="FNanchor_411_412"></a><a href="#Footnote_411_412" class="fnanchor">[411]</a> At the Weigh
House the boast, perhaps, was made that so great was the
trade of the town that the public weighing-machine which was
there kept brought in no less than a sum of £500 every year.
At the Tolbooth and the Guard House, that “long low ugly
building,” which looked like “a black snail crawling up the High
Street,”<a name="FNanchor_412_413" id="FNanchor_412_413"></a><a href="#Footnote_412_413" class="fnanchor">[412]</a> something, perhaps, was said of the Porteous riots. But
the real story of the Heart of Mid-Lothian could only have been
told them by that little child of scarce two years in the College
Wynd, how the wild mob on that September night, seven-and-thirty
years before, burnt down the massive gate of the jail, and dragged
their wretched prisoner by torchlight to the gallows, and how Jeanie
Deans could not tell a lie even to save her sister from a shameful
death. There was no one but this bright-eyed boy who could have
even pointed out in the Luckenbooths the stall where poor Peter
Peebles and Paul Plainstanes had for years carried on “that great
line of business as mercers and linendrapers,” which in the end led
to a lawsuit that is famous all the world over. <span class="sidenote">PARLIAMENT HOUSE.</span>Having no one to
tell them of all this they passed on through Parliament Close,
“which new-fangled affectation has termed a square,”<a name="FNanchor_413_414" id="FNanchor_413_414"></a><a href="#Footnote_413_414" class="fnanchor">[413]</a> to the
Parliament House, which still showed “the grave grey hue that
had been breathed over it by one hundred and fifty years,” and
which was still free from the disgrace of “bright freestone and
contemptible decorations.” The “sorrow and indignation,” which
the restorer’s wanton changes aroused troubled a later generation.<a name="FNanchor_414_415" id="FNanchor_414_415"></a><a href="#Footnote_414_415" class="fnanchor">[414]</a>
Here it was that the Court of Session sat, the High Court of Justice
of Scotland. It was in these August days empty of lawyers, for the
Vacation had just begun; but Johnson on his return saw it also in
term time, and thought “the pleading too vehement and too much
addressed to the passions of the judges. It was not the Areopagus,”
he said. Here Henry Erskine, the brother of the famous Chancellor,
slipped a shilling into Boswell’s hands, who had introduced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_79" id="Page_79">{79}</a></span>
him to Johnson, saying that it was for the sight of his bear, and
here Lord Auchinleck, seeing the great man enter, whispered to
one of his brethren on the Bench that it was <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Ursa Major</i>. In the
Outer Hall had once sat the ancient Parliament of Scotland. Here
it was that Lord Belhaven, at perhaps its last meeting, made that
pathetic speech which drew tears from the audience. Here every
day during term time there was a very Babel of a Court of Justice.
Like Westminster Hall of old it was the tribunal of many judges,
as well as the gathering ground of advocates, solicitors, suitors,
witnesses, and idlers in general. Here it was that “the Macer
shouted with all his well-remembered brazen strength of lungs:
“Poor Peter Peebles <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">versus</i> Plainstanes, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">per</i> Dumtoustie <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">et</i> Tough:&mdash;Maister
Da-a-niel Dumtoustie.”” Here it was that a famous but
portly wag of later days, “Peter” Robinson, seeing Scott with his
tall conical white head passing through, called out to the briefless
crowd about the fire-place, “Hush, boys, here comes old Peveril&mdash;I
see the Peak.” Scott looked round and replied, “Ay, ay, my
man, as weel Peveril o’ the Peak ony day as Peter o’ the Painch”
(paunch).<a name="FNanchor_415_416" id="FNanchor_415_416"></a><a href="#Footnote_415_416" class="fnanchor">[415]</a> Here Thomas Carlyle, a student of the University,
not yet fourteen years old, on the afternoon of the November day
on which he first saw Edinburgh, “was dragged in to a scene”
which he never forgot:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An immense hall, dimly lighted from the top of the walls, and perhaps with
candles burning in it here and there, all in strange <i lang="it" xml:lang="it">chiaroscuro</i>, and filled with what
I thought (exaggeratively) a thousand or two of human creatures, all astir in a
boundless buzz of talk, and simmering about in every direction, some solitary, some
in groups. By degrees I noticed that some were in wig and black gown, some not,
but in common clothes, all well dressed; that here and there on the sides of the
hall, were little thrones with enclosures, and steps leading up, red-velvet figures
sitting in said thrones, and the black-gowned eagerly speaking to them; advocates
pleading to judges as I easily understood. How they could be heard in such a
grinding din was somewhat a mystery. Higher up on the walls, stuck there like
swallows in their nests, sate other humbler figures. These I found were the sources
of certain wildly plangent lamentable kinds of sounds or echoes which from time to
time pierced the universal noise of feet and voices, and rose unintelligibly above it,
as if in the bitterness of incurable woe. Criers of the Court, I gradually came to
understand. And this was Themis in her ‘Outer House,’ such a scene of chaotic
din and hurlyburly as I had never figured before.”<a name="FNanchor_416_417" id="FNanchor_416_417"></a><a href="#Footnote_416_417" class="fnanchor">[416]</a></p></div>

<p>Here every year, on the evening of the King’s birthday, there
was a scene of loyal riot. At the cost of the city funds, some fifteen
hundred guests, on the invitation of the magistrates, “roaring,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_80" id="Page_80">{80}</a></span>
drinking, toasting, and quarrelling,” drank the royal healths to a
late hour of the night. “The wreck and the fumes of that hot
and scandalous night” tainted the air of the Court for a whole
week.<a name="FNanchor_417_418" id="FNanchor_417_418"></a><a href="#Footnote_417_418" class="fnanchor">[417]</a> From the Hall our travellers passed into the Inner House,
where the fifteen judges sat together as “a Court of Review.”
Like Carlyle, Johnson saw “great Law Lords this and that, great
advocates, <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">alors célèbres</i>, as Thiers has it.” There were Hailes, and
Kames, and Monboddo, on the Bench, and Henry Dundas, Solicitor
General. The judges wore long robes of scarlet faced with white,
but though their dignity was great, their salaries were small when
compared with those paid to their brethren in Westminster Hall.
The President had but £1,300 a year, and each of the fourteen
Lords of Session but £700. Six of them, among whom was
Boswell’s father, received each £300 more as a Commissioner of
Justiciary.<a name="FNanchor_418_419" id="FNanchor_418_419"></a><a href="#Footnote_418_419" class="fnanchor">[418]</a> The room, or rather “den,” in which they sat, “was
so cased in venerable dirt that it was impossible to say whether it
had ever been painted. Dismal though the hole was, the old
fellows who had been bred there never looked so well anywhere
else.”<a name="FNanchor_419_420" id="FNanchor_419_420"></a><a href="#Footnote_419_420" class="fnanchor">[419]</a></p>

<p>In the same great pile of buildings as the Law Courts is the
Advocates’ Library, “of which Dr. Johnson took a cursory view.”
He, no doubt, “respectfully remembered” there its former librarian,
Thomas Ruddiman, “that excellent man and eminent scholar,” just
as he remembered him a few days later at Laurencekirk, the scene
of his labours as a schoolmaster. Perhaps a second time he
“regretted that his farewell letter to the Faculty of Advocates when
he resigned the office of their Librarian, was not, as it should have
been, in Latin.” According to Ruddiman’s successor, David Hume,
it was but “a petty office of forty or fifty guineas a year,” yet
“a genteel one” too. When that great writer came to write his
letter of resignation, he used the curtest of English, and took care to
express his contempt for the Curators. Two or three years earlier
they had censured him for buying some French books, which they
accounted “indecent and unworthy of a place in a learned library,”
and he had not forgiven them.<a name="FNanchor_420_421" id="FNanchor_420_421"></a><a href="#Footnote_420_421" class="fnanchor">[420]</a> It was in the <em>Laigh</em> (or Under)
Parliament House beneath, in which at this time were deposited
the records of Scotland, that Johnson, “rolling about in this old<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_81" id="Page_81">{81}</a></span>
magazine of antiquities,” uttered those memorable words which
have overcome the reluctance or the indolence of many an author:
“A man may write at any time if he will set himself <em>doggedly</em> to it.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. GILES’S CHURCH.</div>

<p>It was but a step from the Parliament House to the great church
of St. Giles. Perhaps Johnson went round by the eastern end,
and mourned over the fate which had befallen Dunedin’s Cross
less than twenty years before. A full century and more was to
pass away before “the work of the Vandals” was undone, as far as
it could be undone, by the pious affection of one of the greatest of
Scotchmen.<a name="FNanchor_421_422" id="FNanchor_421_422"></a><a href="#Footnote_421_422" class="fnanchor">[421]</a> Perhaps he turned to the west, and passed, little
recking it, over the grave of John Knox. Even Boswell, Edinburgh-born
though he was, did not know where the great Reformer
lay buried, and a few days later asked where the spot was. “‘I
hope in the highway,’ Dr. Johnson burst out.” In the pavement
of Parliament Close, a “way of common trade,” a small stone inscribed
“I. K. 1572,” marks where he rests. St. Giles’ was at
this time “divided into four places of Presbyterian worship.
‘Come,’ said Johnson jocularly to Dr. Robertson, ‘let me see what
was once a church.’” Writing to Mrs. Thrale the next day he
said: “I told Robertson I wished to see the cathedral because it
had once been a church.” Its “original magnificence,” the loss of
which Boswell justly lamented, has been partly restored by the
lavish changes of late years. Nevertheless, the student of history
may in his turn lament that in this restoration there has of necessity
disappeared much that was interesting. “There was swept away,
with as much indifference as if it had been of yesterday, that plain,
square, galleried apartment,” which, as the meeting-place of the
General Assembly, “had beheld the best exertions of the best men
in the Kingdom ever since the year 1640.”<a name="FNanchor_422_423" id="FNanchor_422_423"></a><a href="#Footnote_422_423" class="fnanchor">[422]</a> Jenny Geddes and
her stool, moreover, are reluctant to answer the summons of the
imagination in a scene which she herself would scarcely have
recognized. Johnson went into only one of the four divisions, the
New, or the High Church, as it was beginning to be called. Here
Blair was preaching those sermons which passed through editions
almost innumerable, and now can be bought in their calf binding
for a few pence at almost any bookstall. <span class="sidenote">SCOTCH CHURCHES.</span> The New Church was
formed out of the ancient choir. In it were ranged the seats of
the King, the judges, and the magistrates of the city. When
Johnson saw it, “it was shamefully dirty. He said nothing at the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_82" id="Page_82">{82}</a></span>
time; but when he came to the great door of the Royal Infirmary,
where upon a board was this inscription, ‘Clean your feet,’ he turned
about slily and said, ‘There is no occasion for putting this at
the doors of your churches.’” Pennant also had noticed “the
slovenly and indecent manner in which Presbytery kept the houses
of God. In many parts of Scotland,” he said, “our Lord seems
still to be worshipped in a stable, and often in a very wretched
one.”<a name="FNanchor_423_424" id="FNanchor_423_424"></a><a href="#Footnote_423_424" class="fnanchor">[423]</a> Nevertheless, it seemed likely that some improvement
would soon be made, and that orthodoxy and dirt would not be
held inseparable companions. In one or two highly favoured spots
the broom and scrubbing-brush had, perhaps, already made their
appearance; for according to Smollett “the good people of Edinburgh
no longer thought dirt and cobwebs essential to the house
of God.”<a name="FNanchor_424_425" id="FNanchor_424_425"></a><a href="#Footnote_424_425" class="fnanchor">[424]</a> It might still have been impossible “for the united
rhetoric of mankind to prevail with Jack to make himself clean;”<a name="FNanchor_425_426" id="FNanchor_425_426"></a><a href="#Footnote_425_426" class="fnanchor">[425]</a>
yet example must at last have an effect. Scotchmen had travelled
and had returned from their travels, and no doubt had brought
back a certain love for decency and cleanliness even in churches.
In one respect, it was noticed, they surpassed their neighbours.
Their conduct during service was more becoming. “They did
not make their bows and cringes in the middle of their very
prayers as was done in England.” They always waited till the
sermon was over and the blessing given before they looked round
and made their civilities to their friends and persons of distinction.<a name="FNanchor_426_427" id="FNanchor_426_427"></a><a href="#Footnote_426_427" class="fnanchor">[426]</a></p>

<p>I inquired in vain when I was in Edinburgh for the Post-house
Stairs, down which Johnson on leaving St. Giles was taken to the
Cowgate. Together with so much that was ancient they have
long since disappeared. He was now at the foot of the highest
building in the town. As he turned round and looked upwards he
saw a house that rose above him thirteen storeys high, being built
like James’s Court on a steep slope. It has suffered the same fate
as Boswell’s house, having been destroyed by fire more than sixty
years ago.<a name="FNanchor_427_428" id="FNanchor_427_428"></a><a href="#Footnote_427_428" class="fnanchor">[427]</a> <span class="sidenote">EDINBURGH UNIVERSITY.</span>From the Cowgate Robertson led the way up the
steep hill to the College of which he was the Principal. They passed
through “that narrow dismal alley,” the College Wynd, famous to
all time as the birthplace of Sir Walter Scott. Johnson would<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">{83}</a></span>
have been pleased indeed could he have known how that bright
young genius would one day delight in his poems, and how the
last line of manuscript that he was to send to the press would be a
quotation from the <cite>Vanity of Human Wishes</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_428_429" id="FNanchor_428_429"></a><a href="#Footnote_428_429" class="fnanchor">[428]</a> “Hæ miseriæ
nostræ,” were the melancholy words which Robertson uttered as
he showed his companion the mean buildings in which his illustrious
University was lodged. Johnson, in the narrative of his tour, no
doubt remembering what he saw both here and at St. Andrew’s,
grieved over a nation which, “while its merchants or its nobles are
raising palaces suffers its universities to moulder into dust.”
Robertson, in an eloquent <cite>Memorial</cite>, had lately pleaded the cause
of learning. The courts and buildings of the College were so
mean, he said, that a stranger would mistake them for almshouses.
Instead of a spacious quadrangle there were three paltry divisions,
encompassed partly with a range of low and even of ruinous
houses, and partly with walls which threatened destruction to the
passers-by. Boswell tells of one portion of the wall which, bulging
out, was supposed, like “Bacon’s mansion,” to “tremble o’er the
head” of every scholar, being destined to fall when a man of extraordinary
learning should go under it. It had lately been taken
down. “They were afraid it never would fall,” said Johnson, glad
of an opportunity to have a pleasant hit at Scottish learning.
In spite of its poverty and the meanness of its buildings, such was
the general reputation of the University, above all of the School of
Medicine, that students flocked to it from all parts of Great Britain
and Ireland, from the English settlements in North America and
the West Indies, and even from distant countries in Europe.
Their number at this time was not less than six or seven hundred;
by 1789 it had risen to one thousand and ninety. The Principal
did not allow himself to be soothed into negligence by this success.
He grieved that “with a literary education should be connected
in youth ideas of poverty, meanness, dirtiness, and darkness.” The
sum of money which he asked for was not large in a country whose
wealth was so rapidly increasing. For £6,500&mdash;not quite double
the amount which he had been lately paid for his <cite>History of
Charles V.</cite>&mdash;sixteen “teaching rooms” could be provided, while
£8,500 more would supply everything else that was needed. Yet
it was not till 1789 that the foundation stone was laid of the New<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_84" id="Page_84">{84}</a></span>
College of Edinburgh. Happily Robertson was spared to play his
part on that great day. Preceded by the Mace, with the Professor
of Divinity on his right hand, and the Professor of Church History
on his left, followed by the rest of his colleagues according to
seniority, and by the students, each man wearing a sprig of green
laurel in his hat, he headed the procession of the University.<a name="FNanchor_429_430" id="FNanchor_429_430"></a><a href="#Footnote_429_430" class="fnanchor">[429]</a></p>

<p>However mean were the buildings in general, with the library
Johnson was much pleased. Fifty years earlier a traveller had
noticed that “the books in it were cloistered with doors of wire
which none could open but the keeper, more commodious than the
multitude of chains used in the English libraries.”<a name="FNanchor_430_431" id="FNanchor_430_431"></a><a href="#Footnote_430_431" class="fnanchor">[430]</a> I was surprised
to find that so late as
1723 the use of chains
was generally continued
in England.
Yet about that time
one of the Scotch exhibitioners
at Balliol
College reported that
the knives and forks
were chained to the
tables in the Hall,<a name="FNanchor_431_432" id="FNanchor_431_432"></a><a href="#Footnote_431_432" class="fnanchor">[431]</a> so
that it was likely that
at least as great care
was taken with books
of value. Johnson’s attention does not seem to have been drawn to
an inscription over one of the doors, which the French traveller,
Saint-Fond, read with surprise&mdash;<span class="smcap">Musis et Christo</span>. Had he
noticed it, it would scarcely have failed to draw forth some remark.</p>

<div class="caption">THE OLD LIBRARY.</div>

<p>From the College the party went on to the Royal Infirmary.
In the Bodleian Library I have found a copy of the <cite>History and
Statutes</cite> of that institution printed in 1749. In it is given a table
of the three kinds of diet which the patients were to have&mdash;“low,
middle, and full.” The only vegetable food allowed was oatmeal
and barley-meal, rice and panado.<a name="FNanchor_432_433" id="FNanchor_432_433"></a><a href="#Footnote_432_433" class="fnanchor">[432]</a> There was no tea, coffee, or
cocoa. The only drink was ale, but in “low diet” it was not to be
taken. It is to be hoped that the Infirmary was not under the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_85" id="Page_85">{85}</a></span>
same severe ecclesiastical discipline as the workhouse. There the
first failure to attend Divine worship was to be followed by the
loss of the next meal, while for the second failure the culprit was
“to be denied victuals for a whole day.”<a name="FNanchor_433_434" id="FNanchor_433_434"></a><a href="#Footnote_433_434" class="fnanchor">[433]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">HOLYROOD HOUSE.</div>

<p>The last sight which Johnson was shown in his “running about
Edinburgh” was the Abbey of Holyrood House, “that deserted
mansion of royalty,” as Boswell calls it with a sigh. It was more
the absence of a charwoman than of a king that was likely to rouse
the regrets of an Englishman. “The stately rooms,” wrote
Wesley, “are dirty as stables.”<a name="FNanchor_434_435" id="FNanchor_434_435"></a><a href="#Footnote_434_435" class="fnanchor">[434]</a> Even the chapel was in a state
of “miserable neglect.”<a name="FNanchor_435_436" id="FNanchor_435_436"></a><a href="#Footnote_435_436" class="fnanchor">[435]</a> It was in Holyrood that Robertson
“fluently harangued” on the scenes of Scottish history. In the
room in which David Rizzio was murdered “Johnson was overheard
repeating in a kind of muttering tone, a line of the old ballad,
<cite>Johnny Armstrong’s Last Good Night</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘And ran him through the fair body.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The mood in which he was when he made so odd a quotation was
perhaps no less natural than Burns’s when he wrote:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“With awe-struck thought and pitying tears,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I view that noble, stately dome,</div>

</div></div></div>

<p>The Castle, that “rough, rude fortress,” was not visited by
Johnson till his return in November. He owned that it was “a
great place;” yet a few days after he affected to despise it, when
Lord Elibank was talking of it with the natural elation of a Scotchman.
“It would,” he said, “make a good prison in England.”
Perhaps there was not so much affectation as Boswell thought, for
Johnson believed, he said, that the ruins of some one of the castles
which the English built in Wales would supply materials for all
those which he saw beyond the Tweed.<a name="FNanchor_437_438" id="FNanchor_437_438"></a><a href="#Footnote_437_438" class="fnanchor">[437]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">INCH KEITH.</div>

<p>On the morning of Wednesday, August 18th, the travellers,
accompanied by Mr. Nairne, an advocate, set out on their northern<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">{86}</a></span>
tour. They were attended by Boswell’s servant, Joseph Ritter, a
Bohemian, “a fine stately fellow above six feet high, who had been
over a great part of Europe, and spoke many languages. He was,”
adds Boswell, “the best servant I ever saw. Dr. Johnson gave
him this character, ‘Sir, he is a civil man, and a wise man.’” At
Leith they took boat for Kinghorn on the other side of the Firth
of Forth. In the passage Johnson observed the Island of Inch
Keith, which, to his surprise, his companions had never visited,
“though lying within their view, it had all their lives solicited their
notice.” He flattered his pride as “a true-born Englishman” by
reflecting, had it been as near London as it was to Edinburgh,
“with what emulation of price a few rocky acres would have been
purchased.” “I’d have this island,” he said. “I’d build a house,
make a good landing-place, have a garden and vines, and all sorts
of trees. A rich man of a hospitable turn here would have many
visitors from Edinburgh.” By his wish they landed, putting in at
a little bay on the north-west, the same “wild, stony little bay,”
no doubt, into which Thomas Carlyle and Edward Irving ran their
boat one summer evening more than forty years later. “We found
the island,” writes Johnson, “a rock somewhat troublesome to
climb, about a mile long and half a mile broad; in the middle were
the ruins of an old fort, which had on one of the stones, ‘Maria Re.
1564.’ It had been only a blockhouse one storey high. The rock
had some grass and many thistles, both cows and sheep were
grazing. There was a spring of water. We pleased ourselves
with being in a country all our own.” The ruins have long since
disappeared; with the stones a light-house was built. How our
travellers were affected by the beautiful scenery that was all around,
if indeed they were affected, we are not told. For natural beauties
Boswell hoped to be able some day “to force a taste.” In the
description of visible objects he honestly owned he found a great
difficulty. Johnson’s descriptions of scenery are almost all of the
artificial school. Both men were far too wise to affect raptures
which they did not feel. Happily the view that the chance wanderer
sometimes sees in that lonely island has been sketched for us by
the hands of a master. Carlyle thus describes what he saw: “The
scene in our little bay, as we were about proceeding to launch our

setting just in face of us, behind Ben Lomond far away. Edinburgh
with its towers; the great silver mirror of the Frith girt by such a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">{87}</a></span>
framework of mountains; cities, rocks, and fields and wavy landscapes
on all hands of us; and reaching right under foot, as I
remember, came a broad pillar as of gold from the just sinking sun;

<p>The weather was fine, so that our travellers had a pleasant
crossing over “that great gulf” which Hume “regarded with
horror and a kind of hydrophobia that kept him,” he said, from
visiting Adam Smith at Kirkaldy.<a name="FNanchor_439_440" id="FNanchor_439_440"></a><a href="#Footnote_439_440" class="fnanchor">[439]</a> In <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite> Matthew

he had been saved “by the particular care of Providence,” he
replied, “Yes, but I am much of the honest Highlander’s mind,
after he had made such a passage as this. His friend told him he
was much indebted to Providence. ‘Certainly,’ said Donald, ‘but

<div class="sidenote">POST-CHAISES AND ROADS.</div>

<p>At Kinghorn, “a mean town,” which was said to consist chiefly
of “horse-hirers and boatmen noted all Scotland over for their
impudence and impositions,”<a name="FNanchor_441_442" id="FNanchor_441_442"></a><a href="#Footnote_441_442" class="fnanchor">[441]</a> our travellers took a post-chaise for
St. Andrews. A few years earlier Johnson would not have found
there his favourite mode of conveyance. By the year 1758 post-chaises
had only penetrated as far north as Durham.<a name="FNanchor_442_443" id="FNanchor_442_443"></a><a href="#Footnote_442_443" class="fnanchor">[442]</a> He found
the roads good, “neither rough nor dirty.” The absence of
toll-gates, “afforded a southern stranger a new kind of pleasure.”
He would not have rejoiced over this absence had he known that
their want was supplied by the forced labour of the cottars. On
these poor men was laid “an annual tax of six days’ labour for
repairing the roads.”<a name="FNanchor_443_444" id="FNanchor_443_444"></a><a href="#Footnote_443_444" class="fnanchor">[443]</a> Used as he was to the rapid succession of
carriages and riders, and to the beautiful and varied scenery in the
neighbourhood of London, he complained that in Scotland there
was “little diversion for the traveller, who seldom sees himself
either encountered or overtaken, and who has nothing to contemplate
but grounds that have no visible boundaries, or are separated
by walls of loose stone.” There were few of the heavy waggons<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_88" id="Page_88">{88}</a></span>
which were seen on the roads in England. A small cart drawn by
one little horse was the carriage in common use. “A man seemed
to derive some degree of dignity and importance from the reputation
of possessing a two-horse cart.” <span class="sidenote">KIRKALDY.</span> Three miles beyond Kinghorn
they drove through Kirkaldy, “a very long town, meanly
built,” where Adam Smith perhaps at that very time was taking
his one amusement, “a long, solitary walk by the sea-side,” smiling
and talking to himself and meditating his <cite>Wealth of Nations</cite>.<a name="FNanchor_444_445" id="FNanchor_444_445"></a><a href="#Footnote_444_445" class="fnanchor">[444]</a>
Here, too, Thomas Carlyle was to have “will and waygate” upon
all his friend Irving’s books, and here “with greedy velocity” he
was to read the <cite>Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire</cite> at the rate
of a volume a day. Along the beach he was to walk “in summer
twilights, a mile of the smoothest sand, with one long wave coming
on gently, steadily, and breaking in gradual explosion into harmless,
melodious white at your hand all the way.”<a name="FNanchor_445_446" id="FNanchor_445_446"></a><a href="#Footnote_445_446" class="fnanchor">[445]</a> Of all the
scenery which Johnson saw, either here or on the rest of his drive,
his description is of the briefest. “The whole country,” he wrote,
“is extended in uniform nakedness, except that in the road between
Kirkaldy and Cupar I passed for a few yards between two hedges.”
Night, however, had come on before their journey was ended, for
they had lost time at Inch Keith. They could not, moreover,
have been driven at a fast pace, for between Kinghorn and St.
Andrews, a distance of nearly thirty miles, there was no change of
horses to be had.<a name="FNanchor_446_447" id="FNanchor_446_447"></a><a href="#Footnote_446_447" class="fnanchor">[446]</a> They crossed, perhaps without knowing it,
Magus Moor, where Archbishop Sharpe, “driving home from a
council day,” was killed “by a party of furious men.”<a name="FNanchor_447_448" id="FNanchor_447_448"></a><a href="#Footnote_447_448" class="fnanchor">[447]</a> In going
over this same moor many years later, Sir Walter Scott, being
moved, as he says, by the spirit to give a picture of the assassination,
so told his tale that he “frightened away the night’s sleep
of one of his fellow-travellers.”<a name="FNanchor_448_449" id="FNanchor_448_449"></a><a href="#Footnote_448_449" class="fnanchor">[448]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">ST. ANDREWS.</div>

<p>Coming as they did through the darkness to St. Andrews, they
saw nothing of that “august appearance” which the seat of the
most ancient of the Scotch universities presented from afar. “It<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_89" id="Page_89">{89}</a></span>
appears,” said an early traveller, “much like Bruges in Flanders
at a distance; its colleges and fine steeples making a goodly
appearance.”<a name="FNanchor_449_450" id="FNanchor_449_450"></a><a href="#Footnote_449_450" class="fnanchor">[449]</a> They arrived late, after a dreary drive, but “found
a good supper at Glass’s Inn, and Dr. Johnson revived agreeably.”
Who was Glass and which was his inn I could not ascertain. The
old Scotch custom of calling a house not after its sign but its
landlord, renders identification difficult. Wherever it was they
found it full; but “by the interposition of some invisible friend,”
to use Johnson’s words, “lodgings were provided at the house of
one of the professors.” The invisible friend was a relation of
that “most universal
genius,” Dr. Arbuthnot,
whom Johnson
once ranked first
among the writers in
Queen Anne’s reign.
Their host was Dr.
Robert Watson, the
author of the <cite>History
of Philip II. and
Philip III. of Spain</cite>,
“an interesting, clear,
well-arranged, and
rather feeble-minded
work,” as Carlyle described
it.<a name="FNanchor_450_451" id="FNanchor_450_451"></a><a href="#Footnote_450_451" class="fnanchor">[450]</a> <span class="sidenote">ST. LEONARD’S COLLEGE.</span> His house
had formerly been
part of St. Leonard’s
College, but had been purchased by him at the time when that
ancient institution, by being merged in St. Salvator’s, lost its separate
existence. A traveller who had visited St. Andrews about the
year 1723 saw the old cells of the monks, two storeys high, on
the southern side of the college. “On the west was a goodly pile
of buildings, but all out of repair.”<a name="FNanchor_451_452" id="FNanchor_451_452"></a><a href="#Footnote_451_452" class="fnanchor">[451]</a> Wesley, who came to the town
three years after Johnson, does not seem to have known how large
a part of the old buildings had been converted into a private house,
for he wrote that “what was left of St. Leonard’s College was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_90" id="Page_90">{90}</a></span>
only a heap of ruins.”<a name="FNanchor_452_453" id="FNanchor_452_453"></a><a href="#Footnote_452_453" class="fnanchor">[452]</a> Of the inside of the ancient chapel Johnson
could not get a sight:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I was always, by some civil excuse, hindered from entering it. A decent
attempt, as I was since told, has been made to convert it into a kind of green-house, by
planting its area with shrubs. This new method of gardening is unsuccessful; the
plants do not hitherto prosper. To what use it will next be put, I have no pleasure
in conjecturing. It is something, that its present state is at least not ostentatiously
displayed. Where there is yet shame, there may in time be virtue.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter w325">
<img src="images/illus_032.jpg" width="325" height="304" alt="" />
<div class="caption">ST. LEONARD’S COLLEGE.</div>
</div>

<p>The virtue was somewhat slow in coming. Saint-Fond, who
got a peep into the chapel, inferred that it was used for a winter
store-house for the carrots and turnips which grew in the kitchen-garden
that surrounded it. It has of late years been cleared of
rubbish and restored to decency, which, perhaps, is all the restoration
that is desirable. Some shrubs and overhanging trees have
been allowed to throw a graceful veil over man’s neglect. One
strange sight the old monkish cells had witnessed earlier in the
century. A man of liberal views had been elected Rector of the
University. In his honour “the students made a bonfire at St.
Leonard’s Gate, into which they threw some of the Calvinistic
systems which they were enjoined to read.”<a name="FNanchor_453_454" id="FNanchor_453_454"></a><a href="#Footnote_453_454" class="fnanchor">[453]</a> Not very many
years before this innocent and even meritorious sacrifice was made,
the terrible flames of religious persecution had blazed up in this city
dedicated to piety and learning. It is possible that Johnson passed
in the streets some aged man who in his childhood had seen a
miserable woman burnt to death for witchcraft on the Witch Hill.
So late as the seventh year of the present century a gentleman
was living who had known a person who had witnessed this
dreadful sight.<a name="FNanchor_454_455" id="FNanchor_454_455"></a><a href="#Footnote_454_455" class="fnanchor">[454]</a></p>

<p>In Dr. Watson’s house the two travellers “found very comfortable
and genteel accommodation.” The host “wondered at Johnson’s
total inattention to established manners;” but he does not
seem to have let his wonder be discovered by his guest. “I take
great delight in him,” said Johnson. How much delight Watson
took in him we are not told. “He allowed him a very strong
understanding;” and as well he might, for he heard some “good
talk.” It was at his breakfast-table that Johnson proudly pointed
out how authors had at length shaken themselves free of patrons.
“Learning,” he said, “is a trade. We have done with patronage.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_91" id="Page_91">{91}</a></span>
If learning cannot support a man, if he must sit with his hands
across till somebody feeds him, it is as to him a bad thing.” It
was here, moreover, that he gave that amusing account of the change
of manners in his lifetime. “I remember (said he) when all the
<em>decent</em> people in Lichfield got drunk every night, and were not the
worse thought of.” That smoking had gone out seemed to him
strange, for it was “a thing which requires so little exertion, and
yet preserves the mind from total vacuity.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">BUCHANAN’S HOUSE.</div>

<p>The exact spot where he was so comfortably lodged is doubtful.
In the Hebrides some of the chambers in which he slept are still
known. In a University, where the traditions of a scholar should
surely linger long, the very house has been forgotten. It is
believed, however, that Dr. Watson occupied that part of the
ancient building which had once been Buchanan’s residence. Some
portion of that great scholar’s study still remains, having outlived
both time and change. Yet that Johnson should not have been
informed of a fact which to him would have been so interesting, or
that being informed he should not have mentioned it, is indeed
surprising. His admiration for Buchanan’s genius seems almost
unbounded. If the city attracted him because it had once been
archiepiscopal, so did the University, because in it Buchanan had
once taught philosophy. “His name,” he adds, “has as fair a claim
to immortality as can be conferred by modern latinity, and perhaps
a fairer than the instability of vernacular languages admits.” Sir
Walter Scott loved him almost as much as Johnson. “He was his
favourite Latin poet as well as historian.”<a name="FNanchor_455_456" id="FNanchor_455_456"></a><a href="#Footnote_455_456" class="fnanchor">[455]</a></p>

<p>Our travellers rose “much refreshed” from their fatigue, and to
the enjoyment of a very fine day. They went forth to view the
ruins not only of a cathedral, but almost of a city and a University.
That it had once flourished as a city was shown by history: its
ancient magnificence as the seat of a great archbishopric was witnessed
by “the mournful memorials” which had escaped the hands
of the devastator. Of its three Colleges only two were standing.
It was “the skeleton of a venerable city,” said Smollett.<a name="FNanchor_456_457" id="FNanchor_456_457"></a><a href="#Footnote_456_457" class="fnanchor">[456]</a> Many
years earlier a traveller, applying to it Lord Rochester’s words, had
described it as being “in its full perfection of decay.” Pennant,
who visited it only the year before Johnson, on entering the West
Port, saw a well-built street, straight, and of a vast length and
breadth, lying before him; but it was so grass-grown, and so dreary<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_92" id="Page_92">{92}</a></span>
a solitude, that it seemed as if it had been laid waste by pestilence.<a name="FNanchor_457_458" id="FNanchor_457_458"></a><a href="#Footnote_457_458" class="fnanchor">[457]</a>
Another traveller, who came a little later, praised “the noble wide
street,” but lamented that most of the houses were “disfigured by
what is termed a <em>fore-stair</em>&mdash;that is, an open staircase on the outside,
carried in a zigzag manner across the front of the house.”
Before most of them was heaped up a huge dunghill.<a name="FNanchor_458_459" id="FNanchor_458_459"></a><a href="#Footnote_458_459" class="fnanchor">[458]</a> A young
English student fresh from Eton, the grandson of Bishop Berkeley,
who entered the University about the year 1778, on seeing “this
dreary deserted city, wept to think that he was to remain there
three long years.” So fond nevertheless did he become of the
place that “he shed more tears at leaving than at entering.”<a name="FNanchor_459_460" id="FNanchor_459_460"></a><a href="#Footnote_459_460" class="fnanchor">[459]</a>
Saint-Fond saw grass growing in all the streets: “Tout y est triste,
silencieux; le peuple, y vivant dans l’ignorance des arts et du commerce,
offre l’image de l’insouciance et de la langueur.”<a name="FNanchor_460_461" id="FNanchor_460_461"></a><a href="#Footnote_460_461" class="fnanchor">[460]</a> <span class="sidenote">GRASS-GROWN STREETS.</span> I was told
by an old inhabitant that not a single new house was built till after
the year 1851, and that not long before that time sheep might be
seen feeding in the grass-grown streets. Our travellers were
touched by the general gloom. “It was,” said Boswell, “somewhat
dispiriting to see this ancient archiepiscopal city now sadly
deserted.” “One of its streets,” wrote Johnson, “is now lost; and
in those that remain there is the silence and solitude of inactive indigence
and gloomy depopulation.” This loss of a street seems to
have been imaginary. He was speaking, no doubt, of the road
known under the name of <em>The Scores</em>, which runs in front of the
Castle, and follows the line of the coast. But along its course
neither pavements nor foundations have ever been discovered.<a name="FNanchor_461_462" id="FNanchor_461_462"></a><a href="#Footnote_461_462" class="fnanchor">[461]</a>
Nevertheless the desolation was very great. <span class="sidenote">THE CASTLE.</span> Over one ruin, however,
a good man might have justly exulted. In the archbishops’
castle on the edge of the sea is shown the dreadful pit in which the
unhappy prisoner, far below the level of the ground, spent his
weary days in wretchedness and darkness, listening to the beating
of the waves. Here ofttimes he waited for the hour to come when
he should be raised by a rope to the surface, as if he were a bucket
of water, and not a man, and dragged off to die before the people.
Sometimes those poor eyes, grown weak by a darkness which was
never broken, of a sudden had to face, not only the light of day, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_93" id="Page_93">{93}</a></span>
the blaze of the torch which was to kindle the martyr’s pile. Thinking
on all this&mdash;on Patrick Hamilton, on Henry Forrest, on George
Wishart, and on Walter Milne, who for their faith suffered death
by fire at St. Andrews&mdash;who does not rejoice that this dismal den
was shattered to pieces, and that where once “an atheous priest”
made the good tremble by his frown, now on the pleasant sward
innocent children play about, and strangers from afar idly dream an
hour away?</p>

<p>None of these thoughts came into the minds of the two travellers.
They did not see this dreadful dungeon, for it was hidden beneath
the rubbish of the ruined walls. The sight of it would, I hope,
have moved Johnson to write otherwise than he did. Had he
looked down into its gloomy depths, he would scarcely have said
that “Cardinal Beaton was murdered by the ruffians of reformation.”
Never surely was a more righteous sentence executed than
that whereby this murderer of George Wishart, in the very room
where, lolling on his velvet cushion, he had looked forth on the
martyr’s sufferings, was himself put to death.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CATHEDRAL.</div>

<p>With far different feelings are we animated as we look at “the
poor remains of the stately Cathedral.” If we do not grieve for the
rooks, nevertheless we mourn over the wild folly which struck
down so glorious a rookery. Would that that fair sight still caught
the sailor’s eye which met John Knox’s gaze when, “hanging tired
over his oar in the French galley, he saw the white steeples of St.
Andrews rising out of the sea in the mist of the summer morning!”<a name="FNanchor_462_463" id="FNanchor_462_463"></a><a href="#Footnote_462_463" class="fnanchor">[462]</a>
Desolate as is the scene of ruin now, it was far more desolate when
Johnson saw it. The ground lay deep in rubbish. The few broken
pillars which were left standing were almost hidden in the ruins
heaped up around them. The Cathedral until very lately had been
made a common quarry, “and every man had carried away the
stones who fancied that he wanted them.” Now all is trim. The
levelled ground, the smooth lawn, the gravelled paths, the gently
sloping banks, the trees and the shrubs, all bear witness to man’s
care for the venerable past, and to his reverence for the dead who
still find their last resting-place by the side of their forefathers.
The wantonness of the destruction, however, mocks at repair.
The work was too thoroughly done by those fierce reformers, and
by the quiet quarrymen of after ages. In all the cities of Scotland
there were craftsmen, but it was in Glasgow alone that they
rose to save their beloved Cathedral. Yet everywhere the people
should have felt&mdash;to use Johnson’s homely words&mdash;as, “wrapt up
in contemplation,” he surveyed these scenes&mdash;that “differing from
a man in doctrine is no reason why you should pull his house about
his ears.” We may exclaim, as Wesley exclaimed at Aberbrothick,
when he was told that the zealous reformers burnt the Abbey
down, “God deliver us from reforming mobs!”<a name="FNanchor_463_464" id="FNanchor_463_464"></a><a href="#Footnote_463_464" class="fnanchor">[463]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">TALK IN THE CLOISTERS.</div>

<p>In the ruined cloisters as our travellers paced up and down,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">{95}</a></span>
while the old walls gave “a solemn echo” to their steps and to
Johnson’s strong voice, he talked about retirement from the world.
For such a discourse there could not easily have been found a more
fitting scene.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I never read of an hermit (he said) but in imagination I kiss his feet: never
of a monastery, but I could fall on my knees and kiss the pavement. But I think
putting young people there, who know nothing of life, nothing of retirement, is
dangerous and wicked. It is a saying as old as Hesiod&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘&#7961;&#961;&#947;&#945; &#957;&#8051;&#969;&#957;, &#946;&#959;&#965;&#955;&#945;&#8055; &#948;&#949; &#956;&#8051;&#963;&#969;&#957;, &#949;&#8016;&#967;&#945;&#8054; &#948;&#8050; &#947;&#949;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#964;&#969;&#957;.’<a name="FNanchor_464_465" id="FNanchor_464_465"></a><a href="#Footnote_464_465" class="fnanchor">[464]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>That is a very noble line: not that young men should not pray, or old men not
give counsel, but that every season of life has its proper duties. I have thought of
retiring, and have talked of it to a friend; but I find my vocation is rather to active
life.”</p></div>

<p>Here, too, it was a different scene upon which he looked from
that which meets our view. The gravestones which are now set
against the walls of the cloisters were then buried beneath the
rubbish of the cathedral. On the other side of this wall, in the
grounds of the priory, were situated those “two vaults or cellars”
where our travellers found a strange inmate.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In one of them (writes Johnson) lives an old woman, who claims an hereditary
residence in it, boasting that her husband was the sixth tenant of this gloomy
mansion in a lineal descent, and claims by her marriage with this lord of the cavern an
alliance with the Bruces. Mr. Boswell staid a while to interrogate her, because he
understood her language; she told him that she and her cat lived together; that
she had two sons somewhere, who might perhaps be dead; that when there were
quality in the town notice was taken of her, and that now she was neglected, but
did not trouble them. Her habitation contained all that she had; her turf for fire
was laid in one place and her balls of coal dust in another, but her bed seemed to
be clean. Boswell asked her if she never heard any noises, but she could tell him
of nothing supernatural, though she often wandered in the night among the graves
and ruins; only she had sometimes notice by dreams of the death of her relations.”</p></div>

<p>I made as diligent an inquiry as I could after this kinswoman
of the royal family of Scotland, but all in vain.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“The glories of our blood and state</div>
<div class="verse">Are shadows, not substantial things.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>The memory has been preserved of “some cellar-looking places,”
but no tradition of human habitation has come down to our time.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Johnson wanted to mount the steeples (writes Boswell), but it could not
be done. One of them, which he was told was in danger, he wished not to be
taken down; ‘for (said he) it may fall on some of the posterity of John Knox;
and no great matter.’”</p></div>

<p>Among the posterity was to be born eight-and-twenty years

Tower I could not ascertain. The staircase, which is perfect, has
in no part a modern

it is possible
that some of the steps
were missing. Saint-Fond,
nevertheless,
went up it not long
after Johnson’s visit.
Sir Walter Scott, a few
years before his death,

that he had not been
strong enough to climb
the tower.</p>

</div>

<p>As we wander among these ancient ruins it is pleasant to think
not only on the days when the cathedral stood in all its magnificence,
and on those other days when the wild mob raved through
it, but also on old Samuel Johnson, wrapped up in contemplation
or preaching about retirement, and on Walter Scott resting on a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_97" id="Page_97">{97}</a></span>
gravestone and dreaming of his first love. We may pause, too,
for one moment in the old chapel beneath the tower, at the spot
where that good man and good antiquary Robert Chambers lies in
everlasting rest. From the top of the tower I looked with pleasure
on the long row of young trees planted along the main street. The
reproach of bareness will not long hang over the town. Indeed,
much had been done to remove it by an earlier generation, for this
noble street was adorned not many years ago by a fine group of
trees. Unfortunately a reforming provost arose, who swept them
away. Near the cathedral I noticed an inscription which might
have called forth Johnson’s sarcastic wit had he chanced to see it.
It bore the date of 1712, and was in memory of “John Anderson
who was Minister of the Gospel of St. Andrews.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE PROFESSORS’ DINNER.</div>

<p>While the travellers were strolling about “dinner was mentioned.
‘Ay, ay,’ said Johnson. ‘Amidst all these sorrowful
scenes I have no objection to dinner.’” They were to be the
guests of the professors, who entertained them at one of the inns.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“An ill-natured story was circulated (says Boswell) that, after grace was said in
English, Johnson, with the greatest marks of contempt, as if he had held it to be no
grace in an university, would not sit down till he had said grace aloud, in Latin.
This would have been an insult indeed to the gentlemen who were entertaining us.
But the truth was precisely thus. In the course of conversation at dinner, Dr.
Johnson, in very good humour, said, ‘I should have expected to have heard a
Latin grace, among so many learned men: we had always a Latin grace at Oxford.
I believe I can repeat it.’”</p></div>

<p>This grace had been written by the learned Camden for Pembroke
College, “to which,” to use Johnson’s own words, “the zeal or
gratitude of those that love it most can wish little better than that
it may long proceed as it began.”</p>

<p>In the afternoon they went to see the monument to Archbishop
Sharpe. His great granddaughter they met at supper. Saint-Fond,
confounding him with Cardinal Beaton, says: “Il parâit
que les parens du Cardinal Beaton n’ont pas voulu déguiser la
paternité du saint archevêque, puisque sa fille est représentée toute
en pleurs, les bras tendus vers son père.”<a name="FNanchor_467_468" id="FNanchor_467_468"></a><a href="#Footnote_467_468" class="fnanchor">[467]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A DECLINING UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p>The two colleges which formed the University greatly interested
Johnson. The natural advantages of St. Andrews for a
seat of learning had been pointed out by an earlier traveller, who
maintained that it had the best situation he had ever seen for an
University, “being out of all common roads, and having fine downs<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_98" id="Page_98">{98}</a></span>
or links, as they call them, for exercising the scholars.”<a name="FNanchor_468_469" id="FNanchor_468_469"></a><a href="#Footnote_468_469" class="fnanchor">[468]</a> The
golfers who now throng the links and boast that when professors
by their learning could not save the ancient city from sinking into
decay, they by their idleness have lifted it into prosperity, must
have been numerous even in Johnson’s time. Of all the old
manufactures, that of golf-balls alone was left, and it maintained,
or rather helped to destroy, several people. “The trade,” says
Pennant, “is commonly fatal to the artists, for the balls are made
by stuffing a great quantity of feathers into a leathern case, by help
of an iron rod with a wooden handle pressed against the breast,
which seldom fails to bring on a consumption.”<a name="FNanchor_469_470" id="FNanchor_469_470"></a><a href="#Footnote_469_470" class="fnanchor">[469]</a> To Johnson,
though he makes no mention of the Links, “St. Andrews seemed
to be a place eminently adapted to study and education.” Nevertheless,
he had to grieve over a declining university. The fault
was not, he said, in the professors; the expenses of the students,
moreover, were very moderate. For about fifteen pounds, board,
lodging, and instruction were provided for the session of seven
months for students of the highest class. Those of lower rank
were charged less than ten. Percival Stockdale, who was there in
1756, says that “for a good bedroom, coals, and the attendance of
a servant, he paid one shilling a week.”<a name="FNanchor_470_471" id="FNanchor_470_471"></a><a href="#Footnote_470_471" class="fnanchor">[470]</a> At this period an Oxford
commoner, Johnson says, required a hundred a year and a petty
scholarship “to live with great ease.”<a name="FNanchor_471_472" id="FNanchor_471_472"></a><a href="#Footnote_471_472" class="fnanchor">[471]</a> To anyone who could pay
for what he bought in ready money, living was made cheaper by
the system of giving a discount of a shilling in the pound. A
Scotch gentleman who resided much in England finding that this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_99" id="Page_99">{99}</a></span>
was not done in that country, “was in the habit when he purchased
anything of putting the cash in a piece of paper, on which he wrote
what it was to pay. This he kept in his desk twelve months,
saying that the English traders are a set of rascals.”<a name="FNanchor_472_473" id="FNanchor_472_473"></a><a href="#Footnote_472_473" class="fnanchor">[472]</a> The poorer
Scotch students, however, had to bear great privations. “The
miserable holes which some of them inhabit,” writes a young
English traveller, “their abstemiousness and parsimony, their constant
attendance to study, their indefatigable industry, border on
romance.”<a name="FNanchor_473_474" id="FNanchor_473_474"></a><a href="#Footnote_473_474" class="fnanchor">[473]</a> At St. Andrews they often were too poor to buy
candles, and had to study by fire-light.<a name="FNanchor_474_475" id="FNanchor_474_475"></a><a href="#Footnote_474_475" class="fnanchor">[474]</a> In spite of the extraordinary
cheapness of the life their numbers were dwindling.
They did not at this time exceed a hundred, says Johnson. Three
years later Wesley was told that there were only about seventy.<a name="FNanchor_475_476" id="FNanchor_475_476"></a><a href="#Footnote_475_476" class="fnanchor">[475]</a>
“To the sight of archiepiscopal ruins,” Johnson was reconciled, he
said, by the remoteness of the calamity which had befallen them.
“Had the University been destroyed two centuries ago we should
not have regretted it; but to see it pining in decay and struggling
for life fills the mind with mournful images and ineffectual wishes.”
Some improvement, nevertheless, had of late been made. <span class="sidenote">ST. SALVATOR’S COLLEGE.</span> Defoe,
in the year 1727, had described the whole building of St. Salvator’s
College “as looking into its grave.”<a name="FNanchor_476_477" id="FNanchor_476_477"></a><a href="#Footnote_476_477" class="fnanchor">[476]</a> The account given by
Boswell of the fabric is much more cheerful. “The rooms for
students,” he writes, “seemed very commodious, and Dr. Johnson
said the chapel was the neatest place of worship he had seen.”
Nevertheless, at the beginning of this century some of the lecture-rooms
were described as being places “in which a gentleman
would be ashamed to lodge his hacks or his terriers.”<a name="FNanchor_477_478" id="FNanchor_477_478"></a><a href="#Footnote_477_478" class="fnanchor">[477]</a> It was
fortunate for the reputation of the College that our two travellers
had not visited it earlier in the summer, otherwise they
would have had to report a disgraceful sight which three years
later shocked John Wesley. It was soon after the beginning of
the Long Vacation that he was there, before the glaziers had
repaired the wreck which marked the end of the yearly course.
It was the custom, he was told, for the students to break all the
windows before they left. “Where,” asks Wesley, indignantly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">{100}</a></span>
“are their blessed Governors in the mean time? Are they all fast
asleep?”<a name="FNanchor_478_479" id="FNanchor_478_479"></a><a href="#Footnote_478_479" class="fnanchor">[478]</a> The young Etonian, Bishop Berkeley’s grandson, had
the merit of putting an end to this bad practice. <span class="sidenote">“WINDOW-CROONS.”</span> On entrance he
was required to deposit a crown for window-money; when, model
of virtue as he was, he objected that he had never yet broken a
window in his life, and was not likely to begin, he was assured that
he would before he left St. Andrews. The College porter, who
collected “these window-<em>croons</em>,” told him of a poor student who
had shed tears on being called on to pay. His father, a cottar,
had sold one of his three cows to find money for his education at
the university, and had sent him up with a large tub of oatmeal, a
pot of salted butter, and five shillings in his pocket. Sixpence of
this money had already been spent, and the rest the porter took.<a name="FNanchor_479_480" id="FNanchor_479_480"></a><a href="#Footnote_479_480" class="fnanchor">[479]</a>
When the window-breaking time came on, and Berkeley was summoned
to take his part in the riot, he refused. As a boy at Eton,
he said, though sometimes with more wine in his head than was
good for him, he had never performed such a valiant feat, and he
was not therefore going to begin as a young man. His comrades
yielded to his remonstrances, and the windows were no longer
broken.<a name="FNanchor_480_481" id="FNanchor_480_481"></a><a href="#Footnote_480_481" class="fnanchor">[480]</a></p>

<p>At St. Mary’s College Johnson was shown the fine library
which had been finished within the last few years. Dr. Murison,
the Principal, was abundantly vain of it, for he seriously said to
him, “You have not such a one in England.” Johnson, though he
has his laugh at the Doctor for hoping “to irritate or subdue his
English vanity,” yet admits that if “it was not very spacious, it was
elegant and luminous.” It is not, of course, to be compared with the
largest libraries at Oxford. “If a man has a mind to prance” it is
not at St. Andrews, but at Christ Church and All Souls, that
he must study.<a name="FNanchor_481_482" id="FNanchor_481_482"></a><a href="#Footnote_481_482" class="fnanchor">[481]</a> Nevertheless it confers great dignity on the
University, and with its 120,000 volumes there is no English
College that it would disgrace. Murison’s vanity had therefore
some excuse. He was, however, a man “barely sufficient” for the
post which he held. Over his slips in Latin the lads sometimes
made merry. In the Divinity Hall he one day rebuked a student<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_101" id="Page_101">{101}</a></span>
for delivering a discourse which was too high-flown and poetical.
“Lord help him, poor man!” said the indignant youngster, “He
knows no better.”<a name="FNanchor_482_483" id="FNanchor_482_483"></a><a href="#Footnote_482_483" class="fnanchor">[482]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">A FINE PLANE TREE.</div>

<p>On the second day of our travellers’ stay “they went,” says
Boswell, “and saw Colonel Nairne’s garden and grotto. Here was
a fine old plane tree.<a name="FNanchor_483_484" id="FNanchor_483_484"></a><a href="#Footnote_483_484" class="fnanchor">[483]</a> Unluckily the Colonel said there was but
this and another large tree in the country.<a name="FNanchor_484_485" id="FNanchor_484_485"></a><a href="#Footnote_484_485" class="fnanchor">[484]</a> This assertion was an
excellent cue for Dr. Johnson, who laughed enormously, calling to
me to hear it.” The Colonel’s father, Lord Nairne, had been “out
in the ’45,” while the son, who fought in the King’s army, had been
sent to batter down the old castle of his forefathers. George II.
wished to reward his fidelity with the command of a regiment, but<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_102" id="Page_102">{102}</a></span>
was hindered by the Duke of Cumberland, “who told the King
that it was impossible that a man who had suffered so much could
ever forget or forgive it.”<a name="FNanchor_485_486" id="FNanchor_485_486"></a><a href="#Footnote_485_486" class="fnanchor">[485]</a> His garden and grotto were at the back
of the Chapel. The grotto has disappeared with its “petrified
stocks of trees,” unless perchance some remains of it are seen in a
small building, which looks like a private chapel, and which might
have been transformed by that ingenious collector of curiosities, the
Colonel. The plane tree survived till about the beginning of the
century. An old gentleman still living was told by his grandfather
that in the branches a wooden platform had been built, on which
tea-parties were held.<a name="FNanchor_486_487" id="FNanchor_486_487"></a><a href="#Footnote_486_487" class="fnanchor">[486]</a> I remember seeing in my boyhood a similar
platform in a large willow-tree overhanging Isaac Walton’s sedgy
Lea. That the good people of St. Andrews have not in their
traditions made Johnson drink a dozen or two cups of tea in this airy
summer-house is a proof either of their truthfulness or of the sluggishness
of their imagination.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A REVIVING UNIVERSITY.</div>

<p>Every Scotchman, it was said long ago, thought it his duty once
in his life to visit “the city of the scarlet gown” and to see the ruins
of the great cathedral.<a name="FNanchor_487_488" id="FNanchor_487_488"></a><a href="#Footnote_487_488" class="fnanchor">[487]</a> No longer, happily, is the mind of the pilgrim
“filled with mournful images and ineffectual wishes;” no
longer does he see “a University pining in decay and struggling
for life;” no longer does he wander through grass-grown streets,
listening to the sound of his own solitary steps. The town is
thriving and animated; the University sees the number of its
students steadily increasing. It had long been depressed by
poverty; but a noble endowment happily has this very year<a name="FNanchor_488_489" id="FNanchor_488_489"></a><a href="#Footnote_488_489" class="fnanchor">[488]</a> fallen
to its lot. If it can never hope to attain to those stately avenues and
lawns and gardens and buildings, as beautiful as they are venerable,
which are the boast of Oxford, nevertheless in the bracing pureness
of its air, in its fine situation on the shores of the northern sea, in its
seclusion from that bustle which distracts the student’s life, and from
that luxury which too often makes poverty, however honest, hang
its head, it has advantages which are not enjoyed by any other of
our Universities.</p>

<p>Johnson, closing his description of St. Andrews with his lament
over its declining University, goes on to say like a wise man:&mdash;“As
we knew sorrow and wishes to be vain, it was now our business
to mind our way.” Perhaps, as he wrote these words he had
in his memory two lines of Matthew Green, though they were<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">{104}</a></span>
originally used of quitting, not what was painful, but what was

<p>He and Boswell started about noon for Montrose on the other side
of the Firth of Tay, a distance of a little over forty miles, but with
good reason made a halt at Leuchars, on observing the fine old
Norman church.<a name="FNanchor_490_491" id="FNanchor_490_491"></a><a href="#Footnote_490_491" class="fnanchor">[490]</a> They were fortunate enough to see it before it
was “restored” for nothing ancient remains but the apse and
chancel. The new portion in the interior is ugly in the most
approved Scottish fashion; in the outside it would be insignificant
were it not added as a vast excrescence to the ancient building. It
stands on a little hill at the end of the village, with the churchyard
round it falling away on the southern side in steep slopes to the
road. Hard by are some well-grown trees round the Manse where
Boswell waited on the aged minister, a very civil old man, to learn
what he could. He was told that the church was supposed to have
stood eight hundred years. St. Andrews certainly can show
nothing so ancient. The village is built solidly enough of stone,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_105" id="Page_105">{105}</a></span>
but seems careless of pleasing the eye. There are no little gardens
before the houses, no roses trained up the walls, scarcely any flowers
in the windows. “Take care of the beautiful, the useful will take
care of itself” has not been a gospel sounded in Scottish ears.</p>

<p>The road to the Tay, which Boswell enlivened by leading
Johnson to discuss the doctrine of transubstantiation, lay through a
pleasant undulating country that bears luxuriant crops and at the present
time is no longer wanting in trees. Their chaise was taken across
the Firth in a ferry-boat at a charge of four shillings. How Johnson,
who always delighted in what he called “the accommodations of
life,” would have exulted in the great bridge which now spans the
flood! He would have noticed too with pleasure the long avenue
of young trees planted along the bank. Passing through Dundee,
“a dirty despicable town” as he describes it, but now the seat of a
vast commerce, they came about the close of the day to the ruined
abbey of Aberbrothick.<a name="FNanchor_491_492" id="FNanchor_491_492"></a><a href="#Footnote_491_492" class="fnanchor">[491]</a> The sight of these fragments of “stupendous
magnificence” struck Johnson perhaps more than anything
which he saw on the whole of his tour. “I should scarcely have
regretted my journey,” he said, “had it afforded nothing more than
the sight of Aberbrothick.” John Wesley declared that he “knew
nothing like the Abbey in all North Britain. I paced it and found
it an hundred yards long. The breadth is proportionable. Part of
the west-end which is still standing shows it was full as high as
Westminster Abbey.”<a name="FNanchor_492_493" id="FNanchor_492_493"></a><a href="#Footnote_492_493" class="fnanchor">[492]</a> It had been left in much the same state of
neglect as the Cathedral of St. Andrews. Boswell, “whose inquisitiveness
was seconded by great activity,” wanted to climb one
of the towers. “He scrambled in at a high window, but found the
stairs within broken, and could not reach the top.” The entrance
to the other tower they could not discern, and as the night was
gathering upon them he gave up the attempt. Not clearly
remembering Johnson’s account, I told the old man who shows
the Abbey that I had read in an old book that a hundred years and
more ago the staircase was broken down. “Then they <em>leed</em>,” he
answered angrily, indignant for its reputation for antiquity. I
learnt from him that an ancient inn, which had been recently pulled
down, had been found to have been built of the hewn stones taken
from the Abbey. In the ruins no doubt for many a long year the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">{106}</a></span>
town had had its quarry. Johnson noticed one room of which he
could not conjecture the use, “as its elevation was very disproportionate
to its area.” <span class="sidenote">THE CHAPTER HOUSE.</span> I was told that it was the Chapter House, but
my informant, a queer little urchin who acted as under-guide, was
not trustworthy, for he informed me that the ruins had been caused
by a fire in which the Abbey was burnt down a thousand years ago.
In this room I found hanging on the wall likenesses of Mary Queen
of Scots and of Pope Pius IX. Surely the bitterness of the Reformation
has passed away even in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RUINS AND ADVERTISEMENTS.</div>

<p>The grounds are still used as a graveyard. Here and elsewhere
in Scotland I noticed in the inscriptions that the English term <em>wife</em><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_107" id="Page_107">{107}</a></span>
is slowly supplanting the old Scotch term <em>spouse</em>. On one side of
the great gateway two ugly arches have been lately built as entrances
to pompous family burial places. These excrescences
should surely be removed and the dead left to their quiet insignificance.
On the outside, underneath a lofty wall, a pleasant bowling-green
has been laid out for public enjoyment, with flower borders
running round. The town was keeping a public holiday the day I
was there, and the ground was thronged with players and spectators.
I was sorry to see in many places that ivy in the true cockney spirit
has been trained up the ruins. Unless the strong sea-breezes,
which cut off the tops of the trees as soon as they show their heads
too high, come to the rescue, it will in time hide the dark red sandstone
beneath a uniform mantle of green. Though the ruins are
now cared for, and the ground cleared of the long grass and weeds
which hindered Johnson from tracing the foundations, nevertheless
the lofty wall close to the main entrance is disgraced by huge advertisements.
As the stranger approaches the venerable pile from
the High Street he gives one angry thought to the Town Council
which leases it to the dealers in sewing machines, in blue, and in Irish
whisky for advertising their wares. “Where there is yet shame there
may in time be virtue.” Would that this protest of mine may rouse
a feeling of shame in the unworthy guardians of so glorious a
ruin!</p>

<p>The road along which Johnson and Boswell drove as they
journeyed from Dundee through Arbroath to Montrose, is described
by Defoe as a “pleasant way through a country fruitful and bespangled,
as the sky in a clear night with stars of the biggest magnitude,
with gentlemen’s houses, thick as they can be supposed to
stand with pleasure and conveniency.”<a name="FNanchor_493_494" id="FNanchor_493_494"></a><a href="#Footnote_493_494" class="fnanchor">[493]</a> Our travellers in the
latter part of the drive saw nothing of all this, for the sun had set
before they left the great Abbey; it was not till eleven at
night that they arrived at Montrose. There they found but a
sorry inn, where, writes Boswell, “I myself saw another waiter
put a lump of sugar with his fingers into Dr. Johnson’s lemonade, for
which he called him ‘rascal!’ It put me in great glee that our<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">{108}</a></span>
landlord was an Englishman. I rallied the Doctor upon this and
he grew quiet.” The town Johnson praised as “neat”&mdash;“neat”
last century stood very high among the terms of commendation,
though it is now supplanted by “elegant” among Americans, and
by “nice” among English people. At the time of the Rebellion
of 1745, the townsfolk had been described as “very genteel, but
disaffected.”<a name="FNanchor_494_495" id="FNanchor_494_495"></a><a href="#Footnote_494_495" class="fnanchor">[494]</a> To the clerk of the English chapel Johnson gave
“a shilling extraordinary, saying, ‘He belongs to an honest church.’”
He had the great merit also of keeping his church “clean to a
degree unknown in any other part of Scotland,” so that his shilling
was well earned.</p>

<p>From Montrose the road led through a country rich with an
abundant harvest that was almost ripe for the sickle, but bare of
everything but crops. Even the hedges, said Johnson, were of
stone. Boswell calls this a ludicrous description, but it could
have been easily defended as good Scotch, for in the <cite>Scots
Magazine</cite> for January of the previous year, we read of “the stone
hedges of Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_495_496" id="FNanchor_495_496"></a><a href="#Footnote_495_496" class="fnanchor">[495]</a> It is strange that Johnson had not noticed
these roughly-built walls in Northumberland, for in the northern
part of that county, according to Pennant, “hedges were still in
their infancy.”<a name="FNanchor_496_497" id="FNanchor_496_497"></a><a href="#Footnote_496_497" class="fnanchor">[496]</a> <span class="sidenote">LAURENCEKIRK.</span> At Laurencekirk our travellers stopped to dine,
and “respectfully remembered that great grammarian Ruddiman,”
who had spent four years there as schoolmaster. More than
seventy years before their visit, Dr. Pitcairne, the author of that
Latin epitaph on Dundee which Dryden translated, being weather-bound
at the village inn, “inquired if there were no persons who
could interchange conversation and partake of his dinner.” The
hostess mentioned Ruddiman. He came, pleased Pitcairne, and
was by him brought to Edinburgh.<a name="FNanchor_497_498" id="FNanchor_497_498"></a><a href="#Footnote_497_498" class="fnanchor">[497]</a> <span class="sidenote">A VILLAGE LIBRARY.</span> Francis Garden, one of the
Scotch judges, under the title of Lord Gardenston, the laird and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">{110}</a></span>
almost the founder of this thriving village, “had furnished the inn
with a collection of books, that travellers might have entertainment
for the mind as well as the body. Dr. Johnson praised the
design, but wished there had been more books, and those better
chosen.” The inn still stands with the library adjoining it. Round
the room is hanging a series of portraits in French chalk of
Gardenston’s “feuars,” or tenants, who, after the laird, were the
chief people of the place when Johnson and Boswell passed
through. Many of the books remain on the shelves, though some
have been lost through carelessness or the dishonesty of travellers.
There are among them a few works of light literature such as
Dryden’s <cite>Virgil</cite>, and <cite>Gil Blas</cite> in French, but the solid reading
which most of them afford makes us think with a feeling of respect
that almost amounts to awe, of the learning of the Scotch travellers
in those good old days. Tavern chairs were no thrones of human
felicity in Laurencekirk if such works as the following were commonly
perused by those who chanced to fill them:</p>


<ul><li>Magno’s <cite>Observations on Anatomy</cite>, in Latin.</li>
<li>Keill’s <cite>Introduction to the Study of Astronomy</cite>.</li>
<li><cite>Aristophanes</cite>, with Latin notes.</li>

</ul>

<p>In Marischal College, Aberdeen, there is a portrait of Lord
Gardenston in his judge’s robes. He has a somewhat conceited
look, such as we might expect in a man who “wrote a pamphlet
upon his village, as if he had founded Thebes,” and who provided
such improving reading for his weary fellow-creatures.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD MONBODDO.</div>

<p>A mile or two off the road from Laurencekirk to Aberdeen
lived the famous old Scotch judge, James Burnett, Lord Monboddo.
“I knew,” wrote Boswell, “that he and Dr. Johnson did not love
each other; yet I was unwilling not to visit his Lordship, and was
also curious to see them together. I mentioned my doubts to Dr.
Johnson, who said he would go two miles out of his way to see<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">{111}</a></span>
Lord Monboddo.” The two men had not much in common except
their love of learning, and their precision of speech. Monboddo,
according to Foote, was an Elzevir edition of Johnson. In a letter
to Mrs. Thrale Johnson thus describes him:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He has lately written a strange book about the origin of language, in which he
traces monkeys up to men, and says that in some countries the human species have
tails like other beasts. He inquired for these long-tailed men of Banks, and was not
well-pleased that they had not been found in all his peregrinations. He talked
nothing of this to me, and I hope we parted friends; for we agreed pretty well, only
we disputed in adjusting the claims of merit between a shopkeeper of London and
a savage of the American wildernesses. Our opinions were, I think, maintained on
both sides without full conviction; Monboddo declared boldly for the savage, and
I perhaps for that reason sided with the citizen.”</p></div>

<p>Johnson a few years earlier had contrasted Monboddo with
Rousseau, “who talked nonsense so well that he must know he was
talking nonsense;” whereas, he added, “chuckling and laughing,
‘I am afraid Monboddo does not know that he is talking nonsense.’”
He was undoubtedly a man of great learning, but he was almost
destitute of the critical faculty. In the six volumes of his <cite>Ancient
Metaphysics</cite> we come across such strange passages as the following:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Not only are there tailed men extant, but men such as the ancients describe
Satyrs have been found, who had not only tails, but the feet of goats, and horns on
their heads.... We have the authority of a father of the Church for a greater
singularity of the human form, and that is of men without heads but with eyes in
their breasts.... There is another singularity as great or greater than any I have
hitherto mentioned, and that is of men with the heads of dogs.”<a name="FNanchor_499_500" id="FNanchor_499_500"></a><a href="#Footnote_499_500" class="fnanchor">[499]</a></p></div>

<p>After stating his readiness to believe that “a tame and gentle
animal” once existed, “having the head of a man and the body of
a lion,” he continues:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The variety of nature is so great that I am convinced of the truth of what
Aristotle says, that everything exists, or did at some time exist, which is possible to
exist.”<a name="FNanchor_500_501" id="FNanchor_500_501"></a><a href="#Footnote_500_501" class="fnanchor">[500]</a></p></div>

<p>The orang-outang he describes as being “of a character mild
and gentle, affectionate, too, and capable of friendship, with the
sense also of what is decent and becoming.”<a name="FNanchor_501_502" id="FNanchor_501_502"></a><a href="#Footnote_501_502" class="fnanchor">[501]</a> The ancients, he
stoutly maintained, were in every respect better and stronger than
their descendants. He shocked Hannah More by telling her that
“he loved slavery upon principle.” When she asked him “how
he could vindicate such an enormity, he owned it was because
Plutarch justified it.”<a name="FNanchor_502_503" id="FNanchor_502_503"></a><a href="#Footnote_502_503" class="fnanchor">[502]</a> In one respect he was wise in following<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">{112}</a></span>
the example of the ancients. In an age when bathing was very
uncommon even among the wealthy, he constantly urged the daily
use of the cold bath. He reminded “our fine gentlemen and
ladies that the Otaheite man, Omai, who came from a country
where the inhabitants bathed twice a day,” complained of the
offensive smell of all the people of England.<a name="FNanchor_503_504" id="FNanchor_503_504"></a><a href="#Footnote_503_504" class="fnanchor">[503]</a> It was believed,
however, that Monboddo impaired the health of his children by the
hardy treatment to which he exposed them. He despised Johnson
because “he had compiled a dictionary of a barbarous language, a
work which a man of real genius rather than undertake would
choose to die of hunger.”<a name="FNanchor_504_505" id="FNanchor_504_505"></a><a href="#Footnote_504_505" class="fnanchor">[504]</a> In the latter part of his life he used
every year to pay a visit to London, and he always went on horseback,
even after he had passed his eightieth year. “A carriage, a
vehicle that was not in common use among the ancients, he considered
as an engine of effeminacy and sloth. To be dragged at
the tail of horses seemed in his eyes to be a ludicrous degradation
of the genuine dignity of human nature. In Court he never sat on
the Bench with the other judges, but within the Bar, on the seat
appropriated for Peers.”<a name="FNanchor_505_506" id="FNanchor_505_506"></a><a href="#Footnote_505_506" class="fnanchor">[505]</a> Yet with all his singularities he was a
fine old fellow. There was no kinder landlord in all Scotland. While
around him the small farms were disappearing, and farmers and
cottagers were making room for sheep, it was his boast that on his
estate no change had been made. Neither he nor his father before
him had ever turned off a single cottager.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of my tenants (he wrote) who pays me no more than £30 of rent has no
less than thirteen cottagers living upon his farm. I have on one part of my estate
seven tenants, each of whom possesses no more than three acres of arable land, and
some moorish land for pasture, and they pay me no more than twelve shillings for
each acre, and nothing for the moor. I am persuaded I could more than double
the rent of their land by letting it off to one tenant; but I should be sorry to increase
my rent by depopulating any part of the country; and I keep these small
tenants as a monument of the way in which I believe a great part of the Lowlands
was cultivated in ancient times.”<a name="FNanchor_506_507" id="FNanchor_506_507"></a><a href="#Footnote_506_507" class="fnanchor">[506]</a></p></div>

<p>He befriended Burns, who repaid his kindness by celebrating
his daughter’s beauty in his <cite>Address to Edinburgh</cite>, and by the
elegy which he wrote on her untimely death. In a note to <cite>Guy
Mannering</cite> Sir Walter Scott describes his supper parties, “where
there was a circulation of excellent Bordeaux in flasks garlanded
with roses, which were also strewed on the table after the manner<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">{113}</a></span>
of Horace. The best society, whether in respect of rank or literary
distinction, was always to be found in St. John’s Street, Canongate.
The conversation of the excellent old man; his high, gentleman-like,
chivalrous spirit; the learning and wit with which he defended
his fanciful paradoxes; the kind and liberal spirit of his hospitality,
must render these <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">noctes cænæque</i> dear to all who, like the author
(though then young), had the honour of sitting at his board.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">MONBODDO HOUSE.</div>

<p>Boswell’s man-servant, who had been sent on to ascertain
whether Lord Monboddo was at home, awaited the travellers’
arrival at the turn in the road, with the news that they were
expected to dinner.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We drove,” says Boswell, “over a wild moor. It rained, and the scene was
somewhat dreary. Dr. Johnson repeated with solemn emphasis Macbeth’s speech
on meeting the witches.... Monboddo is a wretched place, wild and naked, with
a poor old house; though, if I recollect right, there are two turrets, which mark an
old baron’s residence. Lord Monboddo received us at his gate most courteously,
pointed to the Douglas arms upon his house, and told us that his great-grandmother
was of that family.”</p></div>

<p>The old arms are still above the door, with the inscription:</p>

<p class="center">
“R. I.<br />
E. D.<br />
1635.”<br />
</p>

<p>“R. I.” was Robert Irvine, a colonel in the army of Gustavus
Adolphus, the Lion of the North, and possibly the superior officer
of Major Dugald Dalgetty. “E. D.” was Elizabeth Douglas.
Their daughter married one of the Burnetts, of Crathes Castle.
There is nothing wretched, wild, or naked about Monboddo in the
present day. As I saw it, no thought of a “blasted heath,” and of
Macbeth’s witches could by any freak of the imagination have
entered the mind. The land all round has been brought into cultivation,
and there is no moor within five miles. The road along
which I drove was bordered by a row of beech trees, which might
have been planted by Lord Monboddo or his father. The ancient
part of the house, which remains much as Boswell saw it, though
large additions have been made, so far from striking one as poor and
wretched, has a picturesque, old-fashioned look of decent comfort.
Close to it stand a holly and a yew, which have seen the lapse of
more centuries than one. The lawns are wide and soft, and very
pleasant. Hard by a brook prattles along, almost hidden by
rhododendrons and firs. The distant view of the Grampians; the
pure, bracing air, whether the wind blows it from the sea on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_114" id="Page_114">{114}</a></span>
east or from the mountains on the west; the lawns, the trees, the
old house, picturesque in itself, and interesting in its associations,
render Monboddo a most pleasant abode. In the time of the old
judge it was no doubt bare enough. Where there are now lawns
and flower-beds there most likely corn and turnips grew, for he was
almost as fond of farming as he was of the ancients. When he received
our travellers, “he was dressed,” says Boswell, “in a rustic
suit, and wore a little round hat. He told us we now saw him as
<em>Farmer Burnett</em>, and we should have his family dinner&mdash;a farmer’s
dinner. He produced a very long stalk of corn as a specimen of
his crop, and said, ‘You see here the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">lætas segetes</i>.’” An instance of
his “agricultural enthusiasm” used to be recounted by Sir Walter
Scott: “Returning home one night after an absence (I think) on
circuit, he went out with a candle to look at a field of turnips, then
a novelty in Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_507_508" id="FNanchor_507_508"></a><a href="#Footnote_507_508" class="fnanchor">[507]</a> He had a glimpse, it should seem, of some<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_115" id="Page_115">{115}</a></span>
of the wonders which chemistry was soon to work in agriculture, for
being one day at Court, he told George III. that the time would
come when a man would be able to carry in his waistcoat pocket
manure enough for an acre of land.<a name="FNanchor_508_509" id="FNanchor_508_509"></a><a href="#Footnote_508_509" class="fnanchor">[508]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>MONBODDO.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The “farmer’s dinner” was good enough to satisfy Dr. Johnson,
for he made a very hearty meal. Yet with all the pride of a
man who has a vigorous appetite, he said, “I have done greater
feats with my knife than this.” The low, square, panelled room in
which they dined is much as they saw it, with its three windows
with deep recesses looking on to the lawns and trees. It is a solid,
comfortable apartment, which might have recalled to Johnson’s
memory an Oxford Common-Room, and which harmonized well
with the solid talk he had with his host. In it there is a curious
clock, so old that it might have told the hours to Colonel Irvine and
his wife Elizabeth Douglas, and have attracted Johnson’s notice
by its antiquity.</p>

<h2 class="p2"><a name="Aberdeen_August_21-24" id="Aberdeen_August_21-24"><span class="smcap">Aberdeen (August 21-24).</span></a></h2>

<div class="sidenote">THE NEW INN AT ABERDEEN.</div>

<p>Late in the afternoon our travellers drove on to Aberdeen.
“We had tedious driving,” writes Boswell, “and were somewhat
drowsy.” Though they “travelled with the gentle pace of a Scotch
driver,” nevertheless Johnson, much as he delighted in the rapid
motion of the English post-chaise, bore this journey of five-and-twenty
miles with greater philosophy than his friend. “We did
not,” he writes, “affect the impatience we did not feel, but were
satisfied with the company of each other&mdash;as well riding in the
chaise as sitting at an inn.” It was not far short of midnight when
they arrived at Aberdeen. The “New Inn” at which they stopped
was full, they were told. “This was comfortless.” Fortunately
Boswell’s father, when on circuit, always put up there for the five
nights during which he was required by law to stay in each assize
town.<a name="FNanchor_509_510" id="FNanchor_509_510"></a><a href="#Footnote_509_510" class="fnanchor">[509]</a> The son was recognized by his likeness to the father, and
a room was soon provided. “Mr. Boswell’s name,” writes Johnson,
“overpowered all objection, and we found a very good house, and
civil treatment.” A few weeks later the old judge went this same<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_116" id="Page_116">{116}</a></span>
circuit. “Two men being indicted before him at Aberdeen on September
30 for petty thefts, petitioned, and were banished to the
plantations for life, their service adjudged for seven years to the
transporter.”<a name="FNanchor_510_511" id="FNanchor_510_511"></a><a href="#Footnote_510_511" class="fnanchor">[510]</a> What these poor wretches had “petitioned” was
that they might be transported instead of being hanged. The
“transporter,” who bore the cost of shipping them to America, was
rewarded for his outlay by having the use of them as slaves for
seven years. At the end of that time they would have their
freedom; but if they returned to Scotland, and were seized, in all
likelihood they would have been sent to the gallows under their old
sentence. It is not at all improbable that these two thieves were
in the town prison at the very time of our travellers’ visit. If so,
they were separated from them merely by a wall or two; for the
“New Inn” formed part of the same block of buildings as the
common prison. In the central tower the ordinary prisoners were
confined, two rooms in the western end being reserved for burgesses,
“or any of the better rank who were committed for debt.”<a name="FNanchor_511_512" id="FNanchor_511_512"></a><a href="#Footnote_511_512" class="fnanchor">[511]</a>
The judge in all the festivities of his circuit dinner was often close
to some poor wretch whom that same day he had sentenced to the
gallows, and who was awaiting his dreadful end in the gloom and
misery of his dismal cell.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ABERDEEN TOWN HOUSE.</div>

<p>On the other side of the tower, but in the same block, was the
Town House, or Town Hall as we should call it in England.
When I was in Aberdeen, a man of whom I asked the way to the
Town Hall, replied that he did not know where it was; but when
I corrected myself, and asked for the Town House, he at once
showed it me. <span class="sidenote">THE FREEDOM OF THE CITY.</span> Here it was that the freedom of the city was conferred
on Johnson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At one o’clock (writes Boswell) we waited on the magistrates in the town-hall,
as they had invited us in order to present Dr. Johnson with the freedom of the
town, which Provost Jopp did with a very good grace. Dr. Johnson was much
pleased with this mark of attention, and received it very politely. There was a
pretty numerous company assembled. It was striking to hear all of them drinking,
‘Dr. Johnson! Dr. Johnson!’ in the town-hall of Aberdeen, and then to see him
with his burgess-ticket, or diploma, in his hat, which he wore as he walked along
the street, according to the usual custom.”</p></div>

<p>The hall in which the ceremony was performed was a room “46
feet long, 29 broad, and 18 high, with five large windows in front,
with many elegant sconces double-branched set round it, and three<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">{117}</a></span>
diamond-cut crystal lustres hanging from the roof.”<a name="FNanchor_512_513" id="FNanchor_512_513"></a><a href="#Footnote_512_513" class="fnanchor">[512]</a> It has been
swept away with the New Inn and the prison, and replaced by the
stately pile which rises on the old site. The Scotch towns last
century seem to have been somewhat lavish in the honours which
they conferred. Pennant was made a freeman of at least three or
four places. Monck Berkeley, the St. Andrew’s student, had the
freedom of Aberdeen and some other towns presented to him,
though he was scarcely nineteen when he left Scotland. Like the
dutiful young gentleman that he was, “he constantly presented the
diplomas to his mother requesting her to take great care of them.”<a name="FNanchor_513_514" id="FNanchor_513_514"></a><a href="#Footnote_513_514" class="fnanchor">[513]</a>
George Colman the younger, who, at the age of eighteen was sent
to King’s College, says in his <cite>Random Records</cite>:<a name="FNanchor_514_515" id="FNanchor_514_515"></a><a href="#Footnote_514_515" class="fnanchor">[514]</a> “I had scarcely
been a week in Old Aberdeen, when the Lord Provost of the New
Town invited me to drink wine with him one evening in the Town
Hall; there I found a numerous company assembled. The object
of this meeting was soon declared to me by the Lord Provost, who
drank my health, and presented me with the freedom of the city.”
Two of his English fellow-students, of a little older standing, had
received the same honour. A suspicion rises in the mind that it
was sometimes not so much a desire to confer honour as to drink
wine at the public expense which stirred up these town-councillors.
Nevertheless, the testimony of an English gentleman, who a few
years earlier had been made a citizen of Glasgow, goes far towards
freeing them from so injurious a supposition. “The magistrates,”
he wrote, “are all men of so reasonable a size, and so clear
of all marks of gluttony and drunkenness, that I could hardly believe
them to be a mayor and aldermen.”<a name="FNanchor_515_516" id="FNanchor_515_516"></a><a href="#Footnote_515_516" class="fnanchor">[515]</a> With the distinction
itself, on whatever account it was given, Johnson was greatly
pleased. “I was presented,” he wrote, “with the freedom of the
city, not in a gold box, but in good Latin. Let me pay Scotland
one just praise; there was no officer gaping for a fee; this could
have been said of no city on the English side of the Tweed.” In
his own University of Oxford the fee for the honorary degree of
D.C.L. used to be ten guineas. Cox, the Esquire Bedel, records
in his <cite>Recollections of Oxford</cite>, how glum Canning looked when he
was called on to pay it.<a name="FNanchor_516_517" id="FNanchor_516_517"></a><a href="#Footnote_516_517" class="fnanchor">[516]</a> Wesley, who in the April of the previous
year had been made a freeman of Perth, praised the Latinity in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_118" id="Page_118">{118}</a></span>
which the honour was conferred on him. “I doubt,” he wrote,
“whether any diploma from the City of London be more pompous
or expressed in better Latin.”<a name="FNanchor_517_518" id="FNanchor_517_518"></a><a href="#Footnote_517_518" class="fnanchor">[517]</a></p>

<p>The burgess-ticket or parchment on which the freedom was
inscribed, after being read aloud in the hall, was made into a roll,
and, with the appending seal, was tied on to the new citizen’s hat
with red riband. “I wore,” wrote Johnson, “my patent of freedom
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pro more</i> in my hat from the new town to the old, about a mile.”
In his narrative he states that it is worn for the whole day. In a
town of 16,000 inhabitants&mdash;for Aberdeen had no more at that
time<a name="FNanchor_518_519" id="FNanchor_518_519"></a><a href="#Footnote_518_519" class="fnanchor">[518]</a>&mdash;it might be supposed that the face of the youngest freeman
would thus become known to most of his brother-burgesses. But
the population at the present day is seven or eight times as large,
and the old custom has died out, perhaps because its use was lost.
On those rare occasions when the honour is conferred the diploma
is still tied to the hat. The new citizen covers himself for a
moment, and then bares his head while he returns thanks. He
might, I was told, perhaps wear his ticket for a short distance to
his hotel or a club, but certainly not farther. The entry of
Johnson’s freedom in its good Latin still remains in the City
Register. I read it with much interest.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE CHAPEL AT ABERDEEN.</div>

<p>Our travellers, as they passed a Sunday in Aberdeen, went to
the English chapel. The word <em>chapel</em>, as my friend Dr. Murray
has clearly pointed out in his learned Dictionary, which in England
was generally used of the places of worship of the Nonconformists,
and in Ireland of those of the Roman Catholics, in Scotland was
properly and universally applied to the English churches. It is
the term used both by Boswell and Johnson. Mrs. Carlyle in one
of her early letters describes a certain Haddington Episcopalian as
“a man without an arm, who sits in the chapel.”<a name="FNanchor_519_520" id="FNanchor_519_520"></a><a href="#Footnote_519_520" class="fnanchor">[519]</a> “We found,”
says Boswell, “a respectable congregation and an admirable organ.”
By <em>respectable</em> he meant what would a little later have been described
as <em>genteel</em>. “The congregation,” wrote Johnson, “was
numerous and splendid.” The volunteer who accompanied the
Duke of Cumberland’s army in 1747 described the chapel as the
finest he had seen in Scotland. “The handsomest young ladies,”
he adds, “are generally attendants of those meeting-houses (as
they call them here), and are generally esteemed as Jacobites by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_119" id="Page_119">{119}</a></span>
the staunch Whigs.”<a name="FNanchor_520_521" id="FNanchor_520_521"></a><a href="#Footnote_520_521" class="fnanchor">[520]</a> Wesley, who had attended the service here
a year earlier than Johnson, “could not but admire the exemplary
decency of the congregation. This was the more remarkable,”
he adds, “because so miserable a reader I never heard before.
Listening with all attention I understood but one single word,
<em>Balak</em>, in the First Lesson, and one more, <em>begat</em>, was all I could
possibly distinguish in the Second.”<a name="FNanchor_521_522" id="FNanchor_521_522"></a><a href="#Footnote_521_522" class="fnanchor">[521]</a> The Aberdeen chapel was
no doubt one of those licensed ones “served by clergymen of
English or Irish ordination,” where alone in Scotland the form of
worship of the Church of England could be legally practised. <span class="sidenote">THE NONJURING CLERGY</span> At St. Andrews Boswell recorded that he had seen “in one of its
streets a remarkable proof of liberal toleration; a nonjuring clergyman
strutting about in his canonicals, with a jolly countenance, and
a round belly, like a well-fed monk.” By an Act of Parliament
passed in 1747, a heavy and cruel blow had been struck at the
Scotch nonjurors as a punishment for the support which many of
them had given to the young Pretender. Under severe penalties
all clergymen were forbidden to officiate who had received their
ordination from a nonjuring bishop, even though they took the
oaths. They had now to undergo some of the suffering which in
their day of triumph they had inflicted on the Covenanters. They
in their turn sought the shelter of woods and moors. We read of
one of them at Muthill, in Perthshire, “baptising a child under the
cover of the trees in one of Lord Rollo’s parks to prevent being
discovered.”<a name="FNanchor_522_523" id="FNanchor_522_523"></a><a href="#Footnote_522_523" class="fnanchor">[522]</a> Two years later one Mr. John Skinner had been
sent to Aberdeen jail for six months for officiating contrary to law.
He survived this persecution fifty-five years, and so was contemporary
with persons still living.<a name="FNanchor_523_524" id="FNanchor_523_524"></a><a href="#Footnote_523_524" class="fnanchor">[523]</a> By another act all episcopal
clergymen were required, whenever they celebrated worship before
five people, to pray for the King and the members of the Royal
Family by name, under the penalty of six months’ imprisonment
for the first offence, and of banishment to America for life for the
second. Many under this act were thrown into jail, and so late as
1755 one unhappy man was banished for life.<a name="FNanchor_524_525" id="FNanchor_524_525"></a><a href="#Footnote_524_525" class="fnanchor">[524]</a> Others complied
with the law at the expense of their lungs. An English lady who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_120" id="Page_120">{120}</a></span>
visited Scotland about the year 1778, says: “I have heard a
reverend old divine say that he has read the English liturgy so
repeatedly over to only four that frequently by evening he has
scarce been able to speak to be heard.”<a name="FNanchor_525_526" id="FNanchor_525_526"></a><a href="#Footnote_525_526" class="fnanchor">[525]</a> The persecutions had
come to an end by the time of Johnson’s visit. The nonjuring
ministers were, he says, “by tacit connivance quietly permitted in
separate congregations.” On the death of the young Pretender on
January 31st, 1788, the nonjuring bishops met at Aberdeen and
directed that, beginning with Sunday, May 25th, King George
should be prayed for by name. His Majesty was graciously
pleased to notify his approbation.<a name="FNanchor_526_527" id="FNanchor_526_527"></a><a href="#Footnote_526_527" class="fnanchor">[526]</a> Even a tutor or “pedagogue”
in a gentleman’s family was required to take the oaths. This
difficulty, however, was easily surmounted. They could be engaged
“under the name of factor, or clerk, or comrade,” as the
Bishop of Moray pointed out in a letter written in 1754.<a name="FNanchor_527_528" id="FNanchor_527_528"></a><a href="#Footnote_527_528" class="fnanchor">[527]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE UNIVERSITIES OF ABERDEEN.</div>

<p>In Aberdeen there were two Colleges, or rather two Universities,
for each had professors of the same parts of learning and each conferred
degrees. In 1860 they were incorporated into one body. <span class="sidenote">KING’S COLLEGE.</span> In old Aberdeen stood King’s College. The Chapel and its “Crowned
Tower,” founded by James IV. who fell at Flodden, has survived
time and restorers. They are much as Johnson saw them. Of
their architectural beauty and of the ancient richly carved oak
screen he makes no mention: “He had not come to Scotland,” he
said, “to see fine places, of which there were enough in England;
but wild objects&mdash;peculiar manners; in short, things which he had
not seen before.” The discipline of the Universities and the
method and cost of instruction he examined with attention. In
Scotch universities the students generally lived&mdash;as they live at
present&mdash;in lodgings in the town, scarcely under even the pretence
of control except in the hours in which they attended lectures. But
in King’s College a few years earlier the English system had been
introduced. Dr. Thomas Reid, the famous Professor of Moral
Philosophy, in a letter written in 1755 gives an interesting account
of the change which had been made:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The students have lately been compelled to live within the college. We need
but look out at our windows to see when they rise and when they go to bed. They
are seen nine or ten times throughout the day statedly by one or other of the masters&mdash;at
public prayers, school hours, meals, and in their rooms, besides occasional visits<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">{121}</a></span>
which we can make with little trouble to ourselves. They are shut up within walls
at nine at night. This discipline hath indeed taken some pains and resolution, as
well as some expense to establish it. The board at the first table is 50 merks<a name="FNanchor_528_529" id="FNanchor_528_529"></a><a href="#Footnote_528_529" class="fnanchor">[528]</a> per
quarter; at the second, 40 shillings. The rent of a room is from seven to twenty
shillings in the session. There is no furniture in their rooms but bedstead, tables,
chimney grate and fender&mdash;the rest they must buy or hire. They provide fire, and
candle, and washing to themselves. The other dues are two guineas to the Master;
to the Professors of Greek and Humanity [Latin] for their public teaching, five
shillings each. All other perquisites not named, from twelve shillings to seventeen
and sixpence.”<a name="FNanchor_529_530" id="FNanchor_529_530"></a><a href="#Footnote_529_530" class="fnanchor">[529]</a></p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>KING’S COLLEGE, ABERDEEN.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">ENGLISH STUDENTS.</div>

<p>Whether this reformed system lasted in its full extent to the time
of Johnson’s visit, I do not know; some part of it at all events remained.
“In the King’s College,” he says, “there is kept a public
table, but the scholars of the Marischal College are boarded in the
town.” In Aberdeen, as well as in the other Scotch Universities,
students from England were commonly found. Johnson was surprised
at finding in King’s College a great-grandson of Waller the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">{122}</a></span>
poet. But in the state of degradation into which the English
Universities were sunk, what was more natural than that young
Englishmen should be sent to places where the Professors still
remembered that they had a duty to perform as well as a salary to
receive? I have seen in the Royal Society of Edinburgh a manuscript
letter written by Dr. Blair from that town to David Hume in
1765, in which he says:&mdash;“Our education here is at present in high
reputation. The Englishes are crowding down upon us every
season, and I wish may not come to hurt us at last.” Excellent
though the Aberdeen Professors were as teachers, yet before the
great Englishman they seemed afraid to speak. Johnson, writing
to Mrs. Thrale, said:&mdash;“Boswell was very angry that they would
not talk.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>MARISCHAL COLLEGE.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">REYNOLDS’S PORTRAIT OF BEATTIE.</div>

<p>In Marischal College scarcely a fragment remains of the old
building which our travellers saw, except the stone with the curious
inscription:&mdash;“Thay haif said; quhat say thay; lat thame say.” In
the spacious modern library is shown, however, a famous picture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">{123}</a></span>
which Reynolds was at that time painting. On that very morning
when Robertson was showing Johnson Holyrood Palace, Reynolds
began the allegorical picture in which he represented Truth and the
amiable and harmonious Beattie triumphing together over scepticism
and infidelity.<a name="FNanchor_530_531" id="FNanchor_530_531"></a><a href="#Footnote_530_531" class="fnanchor">[530]</a> It was commonly said that in the group of discomfited
figures could be recognized the portraits of Voltaire and
Hume. Goldsmith, if we may trust Northcote, reproached
Reynolds “for wishing to degrade so high a genius as Voltaire
before so mean a writer as Dr. Beattie.”<a name="FNanchor_531_532" id="FNanchor_531_532"></a><a href="#Footnote_531_532" class="fnanchor">[531]</a> If Voltaire’s face is to
be found in the picture, the likeness is so remote that even he,
sensitive though he was, could scarcely have take offence, while of
Hume not even the caricature can be discovered. Feeble though
the allegory is, the portrait of Beattie is a very fine piece of workmanship.
In Marischal College, by the generosity of his grand-nieces
it has found its fitting resting-place, for here for many years
he was Professor of Moral Philosophy. Here a few years earlier
he had been visited by Gray, who, to quote Johnson’s words,
“found him a poet, a philosopher, and a good man.”<a name="FNanchor_532_533" id="FNanchor_532_533"></a><a href="#Footnote_532_533" class="fnanchor">[532]</a></p>

<p>At Aberdeen Johnson had found awaiting him a letter from
London which must have been six days on the road.<a name="FNanchor_533_534" id="FNanchor_533_534"></a><a href="#Footnote_533_534" class="fnanchor">[533]</a> He did not
receive another till he arrived at Glasgow, nearly ten weeks later.
He was now going “to the world’s end <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">extra anni solisque vias</i>,
where the post would be a long time in reaching him,” to apply to
the Hebrides the words which four years later he used of Brighton.<a name="FNanchor_534_535" id="FNanchor_534_535"></a><a href="#Footnote_534_535" class="fnanchor">[534]</a>
It was only seven and twenty years before he drove out from
Aberdeen that the Duke of Cumberland with six battalions of foot
and Lord Mark Kerr’s dragoons had marched forth along the same
road to seek the rebels. With a gentle breeze and a fair wind his
transports at the same time moved along shore.<a name="FNanchor_535_536" id="FNanchor_535_536"></a><a href="#Footnote_535_536" class="fnanchor">[535]</a> Though no<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">{124}</a></span>
military state waited upon our travellers yet their fame went before
them. At Ellon, where they breakfasted, the landlady asked
Boswell: “Is not this the great Doctor that is going about through
the country? There’s something great in his appearance.” “They
say,” said the landlord, “that he is the greatest man in England,
except Lord Mansfield.” <span class="sidenote">THE ROAD TO SLAINS CASTLE.</span> They turned here out of their course to
visit Slains Castle, the seat of the Earl of Errol. The country
over which they drove this day was more desolate than any through
which they had as yet passed. In one place, writes Johnson, “the
sand of the shore had been raised by a tempest, and carried to such
a distance that an estate was overwhelmed and lost.” Sir Walter
Scott, who in the summer of 1814, sailed along the shore in a
Lighthouse Yacht, says that northwards of Aberdeen “the coast
changes from a bold and rocky to a low and sandy character.
Along the Bay of Belhelvie a whole parish was swallowed up by the
shifting sands, and is still a desolate waste. It belonged to the
Earls of Errol, and was rented at £500 a year at the time. When<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">{125}</a></span>
these sands are past the land is all arable. Not a tree to be seen;
nor a grazing cow, or sheep, or even a labour-horse at grass, though
this be Sunday.”<a name="FNanchor_536_537" id="FNanchor_536_537"></a><a href="#Footnote_536_537" class="fnanchor">[536]</a> The Earl who welcomed Johnson to Slains Castle
had done what he could to overcome nature. “He had cultivated
his fields so as to bear rich crops of every kind, and he had made an
excellent kitchen-garden with a hot-house.” His successors have
diligently followed in his steps, and taking advantage of a hollow in
the ground have even raised an avenue of trees. They can only
grow to the height of fifteen or twenty feet, for when the shoots rise
high enough to catch the blasts from the North Sea they are cut
down the following winter. <span class="sidenote">SLAINS CASTLE.</span> The situation of the Castle struck
Johnson as the noblest he had ever seen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From the windows (he said) the eye wanders over the sea that separates Scotland
from Norway, and when the winds beat with violence, must enjoy all the terrific
grandeur of the tempestuous ocean. I would not for my amusement wish for a storm;
but as storms, whether wished or not, will sometimes happen, I may say, without
violation of humanity, that I should willingly look out upon them from Slains
Castle.”</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>SLAINS CASTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Boswell was also impressed with the position of this old house,
set on the very verge of life. “The King of Denmark,” he says,
“is Lord Errol’s nearest neighbour on the north-east.” The
Castle was built on the edge of the granite cliffs, in one spot not
leaving even a foothold for the daring climber. A foolhardy fellow
who had tried to get round lost his life in the attempt. I was
greatly disappointed at finding that “the excellent old house”
which Boswell describes, with its outside galleries on the first and
second story, no longer remains. I had looked forward to standing
in the very bow-window of the drawing-room fronting the sea where
Johnson repeated Horace’s Ode, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Jam satis terris</i>. In the new
building, however, the bow-window has not been forgotten,&mdash;and
there I looked out on the wild scene which met his view. I saw
“the cut in the rock made by the influx of the sea,” into which the
rash climber had fallen as he tried to go round the Castle. Below
me there were short slopes of grass ending in a precipice. So
near was the edge that a child could have tossed a ball over it from
the window. Red granite rocks in sharp and precipitous headlands
ran out into the sea. A fishing-boat with brown sails was passing
close by, while in the distance in a long line lay a fleet of herring-smacks.
The sea-birds were hovering about and perching on the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_126" id="Page_126">{126}</a></span>
rocks, mingling their melancholy cries with the dashing of the
waves. The dark waters were surging through the narrow chasms
formed by rocky islets and the steep sides of the cliffs. For the
storm-tost sailor it is a dreadful coast. <span class="sidenote">A SHIPWRECK OFF SLAINS CASTLE.</span> On a wild night in winter
not many years ago one of the maids, as she was letting down the
blinds in the drawing-room, heard confused sounds which came, she
thought, from the servants’ hall beneath. The butler in another
part of the house had caught them too. Yet when they reproached
their fellow-servants with their noisiness they were told that it was
not from them that the sounds had come. They thought no more
about it that night, but next morning when the day broke the masts
were seen of a ship-wrecked vessel on the rocks below the Castle.
The waves were breaking over it, and not a soul was left alive.
Then they understood that it was the despairing cries of the
unhappy sailors which had in vain reached their ears. The story,
that was told me as I stood looking out on the sea, gave an air of
sadness to a room which had already raised sad thoughts in my
mind. <span class="sidenote">THE EARL OF KILMARNOCK.</span> For on the wall was hanging the portrait of an innocent and
pretty boy who, before so many years were to pass over him, on the
scaffold on Tower Hill was to pay the penalty of rebellion with his
life.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Pitied by gentle minds Kilmarnock died.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_127" id="Page_127">{127}</a></span></p>
<p>On the table was lying a curious but gloomy collection of the
prints of his trial and execution.<a name="FNanchor_537_538" id="FNanchor_537_538"></a><a href="#Footnote_537_538" class="fnanchor">[537]</a> Boswell’s rest was troubled by
the thoughts of this unhappy nobleman. He had been kept awake
by the blazing of his fire, the roaring of the sea, and the smell of
his pillows, which were made of the feathers of some sea-fowl. “I
saw in imagination,” he writes, “Lord Errol’s father, Lord Kilmarnock,
who was beheaded on Tower Hill in 1746, and I was
somewhat dreary.”</p>

<p>In the drawing-room was hanging that fine whole-length picture
of Lord Errol, which led Johnson to talk of his friend, the great
painter, and “to conclude his panegyric by saying, ‘Sir Joshua
Reynolds, sir, is the most invulnerable man I know; the man with
whom if you should quarrel, you would find the most difficulty how
to abuse.’”</p>

<p>In the rebellion of 1745, Lord Errol, following a plan not unknown
among the Scotch nobility, had served on the opposite side
from his father. At Culloden he had seen him brought in prisoner.
“The Earl of Kilmarnock had lost his hat, and his long hair was
flying over his face. The son stepped out of the ranks, and taking
off his own hat placed it over his father’s disordered and wind-beaten
locks.”<a name="FNanchor_538_539" id="FNanchor_538_539"></a><a href="#Footnote_538_539" class="fnanchor">[538]</a> The young man in his loyalty to George II., did
not follow the example of his forefathers, for he was descended
from at least three lines of rebels. “He united in his person the
four earldoms of Errol, Kilmarnock, Linlithgow, and Callander.”
The last two were attainted in 1715, and Kilmarnock in 1746.<a name="FNanchor_539_540" id="FNanchor_539_540"></a><a href="#Footnote_539_540" class="fnanchor">[539]</a>
As we gaze at the haughty-looking man whom Reynolds has so
finely painted in the robes of a peer, we call to mind the coronation
of George III., where he played his part as High Constable
of Scotland&mdash;“the noblest figure I ever saw,” wrote Horace Walpole.<a name="FNanchor_540_541" id="FNanchor_540_541"></a><a href="#Footnote_540_541" class="fnanchor">[540]</a>
To Johnson he recalled Homer’s character of Sarpedon.<a name="FNanchor_541_542" id="FNanchor_541_542"></a><a href="#Footnote_541_542" class="fnanchor">[541]</a>
At the coronation banquet in Westminster Hall, Walpole thought,
as well he might, on that “most melancholy scene” which he had
witnessed less than fifteen years before in that same hall, when the
earl’s father, “tall and slender, his behaviour a most just mixture<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_128" id="Page_128">{128}</a></span>
between dignity and submission,” had in vain pleaded for
mercy.<a name="FNanchor_542_543" id="FNanchor_542_543"></a><a href="#Footnote_542_543" class="fnanchor">[542]</a></p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE BULLERS OF BUCHAN.</div>

<p>From Slains Castle our travellers drove a short distance along
the coast to the famous Bullers of Buchan&mdash;“a sight,” writes
Johnson, “which no man can see with indifference, who has either
sense of danger or
delight in rarity.”
Boswell describes the
spot as:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A circular basin of
large extent, surrounded
with tremendous rocks.
On the quarter next the
sea, there is a high arch in
the rock, which the force
of the tempest has driven
out. This place is called
<em>Buchan’s Buller</em>, or the
<em>Buller of Buchan</em>, and the
country people call it the
<em>Pot</em>. Mr. Boyd said it
was so called from the
French <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bouloir</i>.<a name="FNanchor_543_544" id="FNanchor_543_544"></a><a href="#Footnote_543_544" class="fnanchor">[543]</a> It may
be more simply traced
from <em>boiler</em> in our own
language. We walked
round this monstrous
cauldron. In some places
the rock is very narrow;
and on each side there is
a sea deep enough for a
man-of-war to ride in; so that it is somewhat horrid to move along. However,
there is earth and grass upon the rock, and a kind of road marked out by the print
of feet; so that one makes it out pretty safely: yet it alarmed me to see Dr. Johnson
striding irregularly along.”</p></div>

<p>As the weather was calm they took a boat and rowed through
the archway into the cauldron. “It was a place,” writes Johnson,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">{129}</a></span>
“which, though we could not think ourselves in danger, we could
scarcely survey without some recoil of mind.” He thought that
“it might have served as a shelter from storms to the little vessels
used by the northern rovers.” Sir Walter Scott, however, was told
that this was impossible, for “in a high gale the waves rush in
with incredible violence. An old fisher said he had seen them
flying over the natural wall of the Bullers, which cannot be less than
two hundred feet high.”<a name="FNanchor_544_545" id="FNanchor_544_545"></a><a href="#Footnote_544_545" class="fnanchor">[544]</a> In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for 1755
(p. 200), two strange pictures are given of this curious place, which
must surely have been drawn in St. John’s Gate, Clerkenwell, by
an artist who had never seen it.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DUN BUY.</div>

<p>Not far off is Dun Buy,<a name="FNanchor_545_546" id="FNanchor_545_546"></a><a href="#Footnote_545_546" class="fnanchor">[545]</a> a lofty island rock placed in an angle
of the shore that is formed by no less lofty cliffs. The sea, with
its dark waters in endless rise and fall, washes through the narrow
channel, its ceaseless murmur answering to the cries of the countless
water-fowl who high up on the ledges breed in safety. On one
side, where there is a steep, grassy slope, Dun Buy can be scaled.
I climbed up it many years ago one hot summer’s day, and thought
that I had never seen so strange and wild a spot. Johnson had
also visited it, but his mind was not affected as was my young
imagination, for he said that “upon these rocks there was nothing
that could long detain attention.”</p>

<p>Starting from Slains Castle on the morning of August 25,
Boswell and Johnson drove on to Banff, where they spent the night
in an indifferent inn. In this little town a dreadful sight had been
witnessed when the Duke of Cumberland’s army arrived on an
early day in April, 1746. The savage way in which the narrative
is written, testifies to the ferocity of many of the followers of “the
butcher duke.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At Banff” (writes Ray) “two rebel spies were taken; the one was knotching on
a stick the number of our forces, for which he was hanged on a tree in the town;
and the other a little out of town, and for want of a tree was hanged on what they
call the ridging-tree of a house that projected out from the end, and on his breast<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">{130}</a></span>
was fixed in writing, <em>A Rebel Spy</em>, which, with the addition of <em>good entertainment</em>,
might have been a very famous sign.”<a name="FNanchor_546_547" id="FNanchor_546_547"></a><a href="#Footnote_546_547" class="fnanchor">[546]</a></p></div>

<p>From Banff our travellers drove on to Elgin, passing through
Lord Findlater’s domain. It is strange that neither of them mentions
the passage of the Spey, which ofttimes was a matter of great
difficulty and even danger. Wesley describes it as “the most rapid
river, next the Rhine, he had ever seen.”<a name="FNanchor_547_548" id="FNanchor_547_548"></a><a href="#Footnote_547_548" class="fnanchor">[547]</a> It was no doubt very
low, owing to “that long continuance of dry weather which,” as Johnson
complained a few days later, “divested the Fall of Foyers of
its dignity and terror.” At Elgin they dined, and dined badly.
“It was,” he said, “the first time he had seen a dinner in Scotland

Magazine</cite> for 1771 (p. 544), the Red Lion at Elgin, kept by
Leslie, is described as good. It is added that “he is the only
landlord in Scotland who wears ruffles.” As this was the inn in
which the civic feasts were always held, the honour not only of
the landlord, but also of the town was wounded by the publication
of Johnson’s narrative. I am glad to be able to inform the world
that a satisfactory explanation has been given, and that Elgin and
the Red Lion were not guilty of the inhospitality with which they
have so long been reproached, and so unjustly. It seems that for
some years before Johnson’s visit a commercial traveller, Thomas
Paufer by name, used in his rounds to come to this inn.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He cared little about eating, but liked the more exhilarating system of
drinking. His means were limited, and he was in the habit of ordering only a very
slender dinner, that he might spend the more in the pleasures of the bottle. This
traveller bore a very striking resemblance to Dr. Johnson. When the doctor arrived
at the inn, the waiter, by a hasty glance, mistook him for Paufer, and such a dinner
was prepared as Paufer was wont to receive. The doctor suffered by the mistake,
for he did not ask for that which was to follow. Thus the good name of Elgin
suffered, through the mistaking of the person of the ponderous lexicographer. This
fact is well known, and is authenticated by some of the oldest and most respectable
citizens of the town.”<a name="FNanchor_548_549" id="FNanchor_548_549"></a><a href="#Footnote_548_549" class="fnanchor">[548]</a></p></div>

<p>To Johnson Elgin seemed “a place of little trade and thinly
inhabited.” Yet Defoe, writing only fifty years earlier, had said:
“As the country is rich and pleasant, so here are a great many
rich inhabitants, and in the town of Elgin in particular, for the
gentlemen, as if this was the Edinburgh or the Court for this part
of the island, leave their Highland habitations in the winter, and
come and live here for the diversion of the place and plenty of
provisions.”<a name="FNanchor_550_551" id="FNanchor_550_551"></a><a href="#Footnote_550_551" class="fnanchor">[550]</a></p>

<p>Much of its ancient prosperity has returned to it. If it cannot
boast of being a court for the north, it is at all events a pleasant
little market-town that shows no sign of decay. The covered ways
which in many places ran on each side of the street have disappeared.
“Probably,” writes Boswell, “it had piazzas all along the
town, as I have seen at Bologna. I approved much of such
structures in a town, on account of their conveniency in wet
weather. Dr. Johnson disapproved of them, ‘because,’ said he,
‘it makes the under story of a house very dark, which greatly
overbalances the conveniency, when it is considered how small a
part of the year it rains; how few are usually in the street at such
times; that many who are might as well be at home; and the little
that people suffer, supposing them to be as much wet as they commonly
are in walking a street.’” “They were a grand place for
the boys to play at marbles,” said an old man to me, who well
remembered the past glories of Elgin and the delights of his
youth. Even at the time of our travellers’ visit, they were frequently
broken by houses built in the modern fashion. In many
cases they have not been destroyed, but converted into small
shops. “There are,” writes a local antiquary, “some fine old
piazzas in the High Street which have been whitewashed over and
hidden.” He suggests that some of these might be restored to
the light of day.<a name="FNanchor_551_552" id="FNanchor_551_552"></a><a href="#Footnote_551_552" class="fnanchor">[551]</a> It would be a worthy deed for the citizens, even
in one spot, to bring back the former appearance of their ancient
town.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">CATHEDRALS IN RUINS.</div>

<p>The noble ruins of the great cathedral Johnson examined with
a most patient attention, though the rain was falling fast. “They
afforded him another proof of the waste of reformation.” His indignation
was excited even more than by the ruins at St. Andrew’s;
for “the cathedral was not destroyed by the tumultuous violence of
Knox, but suffered to dilapidate by deliberate robbery and frigid
indifference.” By an order of Council the lead had been stripped
off the roof and shipped to be sold in Holland. “I hope,” adds
Johnson, “every reader will rejoice that this cargo of sacrilege was
lost at sea.” On this passage Horace Walpole remarks in a letter
to Lord Hailes:&mdash;“I confess I have not quite so heinous an idea
of sacrilege as Dr. Johnson. Of all kinds of robbery that appears
to me the lightest species which injures nobody. Dr. Johnson is
so pious, that in his journey to your country he flatters himself that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_133" id="Page_133">{133}</a></span>
all his readers will join him in enjoying the destruction of two
Dutch crews, who were swallowed up by the ocean after they had
robbed a church. I doubt that uncharitable anathema is more in
the spirit of the Old Testament than of the New.”<a name="FNanchor_552_553" id="FNanchor_552_553"></a><a href="#Footnote_552_553" class="fnanchor">[552]</a> While Johnson
censured the frigid indifference of the Scotch, he did not forget
the ruin that was being slowly worked in England by the avarice
and neglect of deans and canons. “Let us not,” he wrote, “make
too much haste to despise our neighbours. Our own cathedrals
are mouldering by unregarded dilapidation. It seems to be part
of the despicable philosophy of the time to despise monuments of
sacred magnificence, and we are in danger of doing that deliberately
which the Scots did not do but in the unsettled state of an
imperfect constitution.” He had learnt, there seems good reason to
believe, that the chapter of the cathedral of his own town of Lichfield
intended to strip the lead off its roof and cover it instead with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_134" id="Page_134">{134}</a></span>
slate. As he had first printed his narrative he had much more
closely pointed the attack. It had run as follows: “There is now,
as I have heard, a body of men not less decent or virtuous than
the Scottish council, longing to melt the lead of an English cathedral.
What they shall melt, it were just that they should swallow.”
Before publication he had the leaf cancelled, from the tender recollection
that the dean had done him a
kindness about forty years before. “He
is now very old, and I am not young.
Reproach can do him no good, and in
myself I know not whether it is zeal
or wantonness.”<a name="FNanchor_553_554" id="FNanchor_553_554"></a><a href="#Footnote_553_554" class="fnanchor">[553]</a></p>

<p>As I turned away from the ruins
with my thoughts full of the past&mdash;of

the strange sights which had been
seen from its tower when the Young
Pretender’s Highlanders hurried by,
closely followed by the English army,
of old Johnson wandering about in the

of the vastness of “the abysm of time”
by which they are separated from us,

<div class="sidenote">THE ROYAL BURGH OF NAIRN.</div>

<p>Leaving Elgin that same afternoon, our travellers drove on to
Fores, where they passed the night. Next morning, continuing
their journey early, they breakfasted at Nairn. “Though a county
town and a royal burgh, it is,” writes Boswell, “a miserable place.”
Johnson also describes it as being “in a state of miserable decay.”
Nevertheless, “the chief annual magistrate,” he says, “is styled
Lord Provost.” If it sank as a royal burgh, it has raised its head<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_135" id="Page_135">{135}</a></span>
again as a popular bathing-place. In this respect it has not its
rival, I was told, in the north of Scotland. Here Johnson “fixed
the verge of the Highlands; for here he first saw peat fires, and
first heard the Erse language.”<a name="FNanchor_554_555" id="FNanchor_554_555"></a><a href="#Footnote_554_555" class="fnanchor">[554]</a> Over the room in the inn where
he and Boswell sat “a girl was spinning wool with a great wheel,
and singing an Erse song.” It was thirty years later that Wordsworth
in like manner heard “The Solitary Reaper”:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yon solitary Highland lass</div>
<div class="verse">Reaping and singing by herself.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>Even so far back as the reign of James VI. both languages were
spoken in Nairn. “It was one of that king’s witticisms to boast
that in Scotland he had a town ‘sae lang that the folk at the tae
end couldna understand the tongue spoken at the tother.’”<a name="FNanchor_555_556" id="FNanchor_555_556"></a><a href="#Footnote_555_556" class="fnanchor">[555]</a>
Gaelic is no longer heard in its streets. The verge of the Higher
lands must now be fixed farther to the west. Nine years before
Johnson’s visit the little town had been stirred up by Wesley. On
Monday, June 11, 1764, he recorded in his journal: “While we
were dining at Nairn, the innkeeper said, ‘Sir, the gentlemen of
the town have read the little book you gave me on Saturday, and
would be glad if you would please give them a sermon.’ Upon my
consenting, the bell was immediately rung, and the congregation
was quickly in the kirk.”<a name="FNanchor_556_557" id="FNanchor_556_557"></a><a href="#Footnote_556_557" class="fnanchor">[556]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">CAWDOR MANSE.</div>

<p>From Nairn our travellers turned a few miles out of their
course to visit the Rev. Kenneth Macaulay in his manse at
Cawdor. To Johnson he was known by his <cite>History of St. Kilda</cite>&mdash;“a
very pretty piece of topography” as he called it to the
author, “who did not seem much to mind the compliment.” To
us he is interesting as the great-uncle of Lord Macaulay. “From
his conversation,” says Boswell, “Dr. Johnson was convinced that
he had not written the book which goes under his name. ‘There
is a combination in it’ (he said) ‘of which Macaulay is not
capable.’” “To those who happen to have read the work,”
writes Sir George Trevelyan, “Johnson’s decision will give a very
poor notion of my ancestor’s abilities.”<a name="FNanchor_557_558" id="FNanchor_557_558"></a><a href="#Footnote_557_558" class="fnanchor">[557]</a> Let him take comfort. The
present minister of Cawdor, to whose civility I am indebted, told<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_136" id="Page_136">{136}</a></span>
me that in the Kirk Session Records is a minute by Macaulay
“most beautifully expressed.” I had hoped to sit in the very
parlour where Johnson had reproached him with being “a bigot
to laxness,” and where he had given his little son a Sallust, promising
at the same time to get him a servitorship at Oxford when
he was ready for the University. But hopes that are based on
the permanence of buildings are often disappointed. Of the
old manse nothing remains. The minister, who rejoiced in having
a more comfortable home than his predecessors, refused to share in
my sentimental regrets. The situation seemed a pleasant one, as
I saw it on a fine evening in July, with the sun setting behind the
hills on the other side of
the Moray Firth. The
haymakers were busy at
their work close to the
house, in a field which
is bounded on one side
by a deep hollow, with
a little brook flowing at
the bottom, and in front
by a row of old ash
trees.</p>

<div class="sidenote">TALK IN CAWDOR MANSE.</div>

<p>In the company of
Macaulay Boswell “had
dreaded that a whole
evening would be heavy.
However,” he adds, “Mr.
Grant, an intelligent and well-bred minister in the neighbourhood,
was there, and assisted us by his conversation.” His grandson is
Colonel Grant, who shares with Captain Speke the glory of having
discovered the sources of the Nile. It was indeed an unusual
gathering that August evening in the parlour of the quiet manse&mdash;Johnson,
the first of talkers, Boswell, the first of biographers, the
great-uncle of our famous historian, and the grandfather of our
famous discoverer. My hopes rose high when I was told that a
diary which Mr. Grant kept was still in existence. Of this evening’s
talk some record surely would have been made. With
sorrow I learnt from his grandson that “accounts of expenses,
sermons preached, peat-cutting, stipends, washing <em>twice a year</em>,
births, &amp;c., are the principal things which are mentioned.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">{137}</a></span>
washing twice a year must not be taken as a proof that this divine
“had no passion for clean linen.” A Scotch friend of mine remembers
a man who owned three farms in the neighbourhood of
Campbeltown. In his house they only washed twice a year,
though both he and his three sons who lived with him changed
their shirts every second day. A time was chosen when there was
a slackness in the ordinary work, and then the female servants
were gathered from the three farms for a week’s hard washing.
This same custom exists, I
believe, to the present day in
Norway. <span class="sidenote">CAWDOR CHURCH.</span> In the churchyard I
found Mr. Grant’s tombstone.
He lived till 1828&mdash;fifty-five
years after he had met Johnson.
He used to tell a story
about the doctor which
happily has been preserved.
He had supped with him, as
we learn from Boswell, at the
inn at Inverness. Johnson,
who was in high spirits, gave
an account of the kangaroo,
which had lately been discovered
in New South Wales,
“and volunteered an imitation
of the animal. The company
stared; Mr. Grant said
nothing could be more ludicrous
than the appearance of
a tall, heavy, grave-looking
man like Dr. Johnson standing up to mimic the shape and motions of a
kangaroo. He stood erect, put out his hands like feelers, and gathering
up the tails of his huge brown coat so as to resemble the pouch
of the animal, made two or three vigorous bounds across the room.”<a name="FNanchor_558_559" id="FNanchor_558_559"></a><a href="#Footnote_558_559" class="fnanchor">[558]</a></p>

<p>Near Mr. Grant lies his friend and predecessor Kenneth
Macaulay, with an inscription which tells that he was “notus in
fratres animi paterni.” This <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus paternus</i> descended in full
measure to Lord Macaulay. On the porch of the church is still
fastened by an iron chain the old penance-ring which Pennant saw<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">{138}</a></span>
one hundred and twenty years ago. “Observed,” he writes, “on
a pillar of the door of Calder church a <em>joug</em>, <abbr title="id est">i.e.</abbr>, an iron yoke or ring,
fastened to a chain; which was in former times put round the necks
of delinquents against the rules of the Church, who were left there
exposed to shame during the time of divine service, and was also
used as a punishment for defamation, small thefts, &amp;c., but these
penalties are now happily abolished.”<a name="FNanchor_559_560" id="FNanchor_559_560"></a><a href="#Footnote_559_560" class="fnanchor">[559]</a> From such penance as this
there was perhaps an escape for those who were well-to-do. From
<cite>Hudibras</cite> we learn that the Presbyterian saints could “sentence to
stools or poundage of repentance,” which passage is explained by the
commentator as “doing penance in the Scotch way, upon the stool
of repentance, or commuting the penance for a sum of money.”<a name="FNanchor_560_561" id="FNanchor_560_561"></a><a href="#Footnote_560_561" class="fnanchor">[560]</a></p>

<p>“By the direction of Mr. Macaulay,” writes Johnson, “we visited
Cawdor Castle, from which Macbeth drew his second title.” That
they should have needed a direction to visit so beautiful a spot
seems strange, for they must have passed close by it on their way
to the manse. As I first caught sight of it by the light of a summer
evening, I thought that I had rarely seen a fairer spot. This castle
hath indeed a pleasant seat, I said. All the barrenness of the
eastern coast I had left behind me, and had found in its stead a
luxuriance of growth that would have graced the oldest mansion in
England. Everything seemed beautiful, and everything harmonious&mdash;the
ancient castle,
with its high-pitched
roof and its lofty
tower; the swift-flowing
river, with its
bridge of a single arch;
the curve in the road
where it crosses it;
the avenue of lofty
trees, the lawns enclosed
by limes, the
shrubberies, and the
range of mountains
in the distance still
showing the light of the sun which had set for us. The water
murmured pleasantly, and a gentle breeze rustled the leaves. I
found a little inn close by the park gate, where homely fare
and decent lodging are provided. A man of a quiet meditative
mind might pass a few days there pleasantly enough if he sought
shelter in the woods on the afternoons when the castle is thrown
open to visitors. Next morning I watched the school-children,
bare-footed, but clean and tidy, carrying on their arms their slates
covered with sums in neat figures, trooping merrily by, and winding
over the bridge on their way to school. By the kindness of the
Earl of Cawdor I was allowed to go over the castle from turret
almost to foundation-stone at a time when it was not generally open.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The old tower,” says Boswell, “must be of great antiquity. There is a draw-bridge&mdash;what
has been a moat&mdash;and an ancient court. There is a hawthorn-tree,
which rises like a wooden pillar through the rooms of the castle; for, by a strange
conceit, the walls have been built round it. The thickness of the walls, the small<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">{140}</a></span>
slanting windows, and a great iron door at the entrance on the second story as you
ascend the stairs, all indicate the rude times in which this castle was erected. There
were here some large venerable trees.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter w450">
<img src="images/illus_057.jpg" width="450" height="448" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>VAULT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>It is surprising that he should have thought that there could ever
have been a moat on a rock high above the river. Johnson nevertheless
also mentions it. What they mistook for a moat is the
excavation made in quarrying the stone for the castle. In clearing
it out some while ago, the workmen came to a place where the
masons had left some stones half dressed. Mr. Irving, who visited
Cawdor, has had the fine entrance copied, I am told, in his scenery
for Macbeth, adding, however, a portcullis, of which no traces remain.
I was shown in a kind of vault the trunk of the old hawthorn
which Boswell mentions. There is a tradition that “a wise<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">{141}</a></span>
man counselled a certain thane to load an ass with a chest full of
gold, and to build his castle with the money at the third hawthorn-tree
at which the animal should stop.” The ass stopped where
Cawdor Castle is built, and the tree was enclosed. The thane’s
only child, a little girl, was carried off by Campbell of Inverliver,
on Loch Awe. In his flight he was overtaken by the Cawdors.
Being hard pressed, “he cried out in Gaelic, ‘It is a far cry to
Loch Awe, and a distant help to the Campbells,’ a saying which
became proverbial in the north to express imminent danger and
distant relief.”<a name="FNanchor_561_562" id="FNanchor_561_562"></a><a href="#Footnote_561_562" class="fnanchor">[561]</a> He won the day, however, and the child when
she grew up married a son of the Earl of Argyle. From them is
descended that “prosperous gentleman,” the present Thane or
Earl of Cawdor.</p>

<p>I passed through the great iron door which Boswell mentions,
and other strong doors too, and climbed up the staircase which is
built in the thickness of the wall. I was shown the place in the
roof where Lord Lovat, when fleeing from justice early in his bad
career, had lain in hiding for some weeks. I saw, moreover, more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_142" id="Page_142">{142}</a></span>
than one chamber hung with old tapestry. In one of them stands
the state bed of Sir Hugh Campbell, who in 1672 married Lady
Henrietta Stewart. Their initials, with the date, are carved on the
outside wall of the court. At one end of the hall runs a gallery
which bears the name of the Fiddler’s Walk. There the musicians
used to play, keeping time with their steps to their tune.</p>

<p>From Cawdor Johnson and Boswell drove to Fort George,
“the most regular fortification in the island,” according to Johnson;
“where,” he continues, “they were entertained by Sir Eyre Coote,
the Governor, with such elegance of conversation, as left us no
attention to the delicacies of his table.” Wolfe, who saw it in
1751, when it was partly made, writes: “I believe there is still
work for six or seven years to do. When it is finished one may
venture to say (without saying much) that it will be the most considerable
fortress, and the best situated in Great Britain.”<a name="FNanchor_562_563" id="FNanchor_562_563"></a><a href="#Footnote_562_563" class="fnanchor">[562]</a> In the

is perhaps merely due to the dusk of evening, in which they passed
by the spot. It is not unlikely, on the other hand, that the silence
was intentional. Johnson shows a curious reticence in a passage
in which he refers to the Rebellion of 1745. In his description of
Rasay he writes: “Not many years ago the late laird led out one
hundred men upon a military expedition.” <span class="sidenote">THE BUTCHER DUKE.</span> Had he visited Culloden
or described the campaign, his indignation must have flamed
forth at the cruelties of the butcher duke. Boswell, Lowlander
though he was, said “that they would never be forgotten.” With
Smollett, in his <cite>Tears of Scotland</cite>, they might well have exclaimed:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yet when the rage of battle ceased,</div>
<div class="verse">The victor’s soul was not appeased:</div>

</div></div></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">{143}</a></span></p>

<p>Johnson does indeed speak of “the heavy hand of a vindictive
conqueror.”<a name="FNanchor_564_565" id="FNanchor_564_565"></a><a href="#Footnote_564_565" class="fnanchor">[564]</a> It was about this time, or only a little later, that
Scott was learning “to detest the name of Cumberland with more
than infant hatred.”<a name="FNanchor_565_566" id="FNanchor_565_566"></a><a href="#Footnote_565_566" class="fnanchor">[565]</a> That an Englishman could travel in safety,
unarmed and unguarded, through a country which only seven and
twenty years before had been so mercilessly treated seems not a
little surprising. For the next day or two he was to follow a
course where fire and sword had swept along. Wolfe, whose
“great name,” we boast, was “compatriot with our own,” who had
so little of the savage spirit of war that he would rather have
written Gray’s <cite>Elegy</cite> than take Quebec, even he exulted that “as
few prisoners were taken of the Highlanders as possible. We had
an opportunity of avenging ourselves. The rebels left near 1,500
dead.” Yet he did not think that enough had been done. The
carnage-pile was not lofty enough. Surveying the battle-field five
years later, he writes in a letter to his father, a general in the
army, “I find room for a military criticism. You would not have
left those ruffians the only possible means of conquest, nor suffered
multitudes to go off unhurt with the power to destroy.”<a name="FNanchor_566_567" id="FNanchor_566_567"></a><a href="#Footnote_566_567" class="fnanchor">[566]</a> Ruffians
indeed they had shown themselves in their raid into England, but
enough surely had been done in the way of slaughter to satisfy
the most exacting military critic. How merciless our soldiers had
been is proved by the letters that were written from the camp. A
despatch sent off from Inverness on April 25, nine days after the
battle, says that “the misery and distress of the fugitive rebels was
inexpressible, hundreds being found dead of their wounds and
through hunger at the distance of twelve, fourteen, and even
twenty miles from the field.”<a name="FNanchor_567_568" id="FNanchor_567_568"></a><a href="#Footnote_567_568" class="fnanchor">[567]</a> On June 5 an officer wrote from
Fort Augustus: “His Royal Highness has carried fire and sword
through their country, and driven off their cattle, which we bring
to our camp in great quantities, sometimes 2,000 in a drove. The
people are deservedly in a most deplorable way, and must perish
either by sword or famine, a just reward for traitors.”<a name="FNanchor_568_569" id="FNanchor_568_569"></a><a href="#Footnote_568_569" class="fnanchor">[568]</a></p>

<p>On July 26 another officer wrote from the same fort to a friend
at Newcastle: “We hang or shoot everyone that is known to conceal
the Pretender, burn their houses and take their cattle, of
which we have got some 8,000 head within these few days past, so<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_144" id="Page_144">{144}</a></span>

the Rebellion</cite>, tells with exultation how “they marched to Loch
Yell, the stately seat of old Esquire Cameron,” the Lochiel of
Campbell’s spirited lines. “His fine chairs, tables, and all his
cabinet goods were set on fire and burnt with his house. His fine
fruit garden, above a mile long, was pulled to pieces and laid
waste. A beautiful summer-house that stood in the pleasure
garden was also set on fire. From hence the party marched along
the sea-coast through Moidart, burning of houses, driving away the
cattle, and shooting those vagrants who were found about the
mountains. For fifty miles round there was no man or beast to
be seen.”<a name="FNanchor_570_571" id="FNanchor_570_571"></a><a href="#Footnote_570_571" class="fnanchor">[570]</a> Andrew Henderson, in his <cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, after
admitting that in the rout several of the wounded were stabbed, and
some who were lurking in houses were taken out and shot, urges
by way of excuse that “the rebels had enraged the troops; their
habit was strange, their language still stranger, and their way of
fighting was shocking to the utmost degree.”<a name="FNanchor_571_572" id="FNanchor_571_572"></a><a href="#Footnote_571_572" class="fnanchor">[571]</a> Besides the massacre
after the battle and the executions by courts-martial, there
were the hangings, drawings and quarterings, and beheadings
by judge and jury. Seventy-six had been sent to the scaffold
by September, 1747,<a name="FNanchor_572_573" id="FNanchor_572_573"></a><a href="#Footnote_572_573" class="fnanchor">[572]</a> and above one thousand were transported.<a name="FNanchor_573_574" id="FNanchor_573_574"></a><a href="#Footnote_573_574" class="fnanchor">[573]</a>
Even George II. “said that he believed William had been rough
with them.”<a name="FNanchor_574_575" id="FNanchor_574_575"></a><a href="#Footnote_574_575" class="fnanchor">[574]</a> When it was proposed to confer on the duke the
freedom of the City of London, an alderman was heard to say that
it ought to be the freedom of the Butchers’ Company. So late as
the summer of 1753 seven rebels were seized in a hut on the side
of Loch Hourn, at no great distance from the way along which
Johnson was to pass only twenty years later.<a name="FNanchor_575_576" id="FNanchor_575_576"></a><a href="#Footnote_575_576" class="fnanchor">[575]</a> Nevertheless he
everywhere travelled in safety. Among the chieftains, no doubt,
“his tenderness for the unfortunate House of Stuart” was known,
but to the common people he would only be an Englishman&mdash;a
man of the race that had slaughtered their fathers and wasted their
country. That both he and Boswell were not free from uneasiness
they avowed when at Auchnasheal they were surrounded by the
wild McCraas. In the memory of men not much past the middle<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_145" id="Page_145">{145}</a></span>
age, tales of the cruel duke used to be told in the winter evenings
in the glens of these Western Highlands. They have at last died
away, and “infant hatred” is no longer nourished.<a name="FNanchor_576_577" id="FNanchor_576_577"></a><a href="#Footnote_576_577" class="fnanchor">[576]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">INVERNESS.</div>

<p>Our travellers, whatever may have been their motive, leaving
the Field of Culloden unvisited and unnoticed, arrived at Inverness,
the capital of the Highlands. They put up at Mackenzie’s
Inn. Of their accommodation they say nothing; but it can
scarcely have been good, if we may trust an English traveller who
two years earlier had found, he said, the Horns Inn, kept by
Mrs. Mackenzie, dirty and ill-managed.<a name="FNanchor_577_578" id="FNanchor_577_578"></a><a href="#Footnote_577_578" class="fnanchor">[577]</a> Perhaps they felt as
Wolfe did when he was stationed in the town with his regiment.
“It would be unmanly,” he wrote, “and very unbecoming a soldier
to complain of little evils, such as bad food, bad lodging, bad fire....
With these reflections I reconcile myself to Inverness, and to
other melancholy spots that we are thrown upon.” He adds that
the post goes but once a week, and that as there are rapid rivers
on the road that have neither bridge nor boat, it is often delayed
by the floods.<a name="FNanchor_578_579" id="FNanchor_578_579"></a><a href="#Footnote_578_579" class="fnanchor">[578]</a> Wesley describes Inverness as the largest town he
had seen in Scotland after Edinburgh, Glasgow, and Aberdeen.
“It stands in a pleasant and fruitful country, and has all things
needful for life and godliness. The people in general speak remarkably
good English, and are of a friendly, courteous behaviour.”<a name="FNanchor_579_580" id="FNanchor_579_580"></a><a href="#Footnote_579_580" class="fnanchor">[579]</a>
Their good English they were said to derive from the
garrison which Cromwell had settled among them. It had been
noticed by Defoe. “They speak,” he said, “perfect English, even
much better than in the most southerly provinces of Scotland; nay,
some will say that they speak it as well as at London, though I do
not grant that neither.”<a name="FNanchor_580_581" id="FNanchor_580_581"></a><a href="#Footnote_580_581" class="fnanchor">[580]</a> Their behaviour had greatly improved
in the thirteen years which had elapsed between Wolfe’s second
and Wesley’s first visit, unless the soldier had viewed them with
the stern eye of the conqueror, or they had displayed the sullenness
of the conquered. “A little while,” he wrote, “serves to
discover the villainous nature of the inhabitants and brutality of
the people in the neighbourhood.”<a name="FNanchor_581_582" id="FNanchor_581_582"></a><a href="#Footnote_581_582" class="fnanchor">[581]</a> Yet the brutality was quite
as much on the side of the army, for a year later, five full years
after the battle, we find the people still treated with harshness and
insolence. The magistrates had invited Lord Bury, the general in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_146" id="Page_146">{146}</a></span>
command, to an entertainment on the Duke of Cumberland’s
birthday. “He said he did not doubt but it would be more
agreeable to the duke if they postponed it to the day following,
the anniversary of Culloden. They stared, said they could not promise
on their own authority, but would go and consult their body.
They returned, told him it was unprecedented and could not be
complied with. Lord Bury replied he was sorry they had not
given a negative at once, for he had mentioned it to his soldiers,
who would not bear a disappointment, and was afraid it would provoke
them to some outrage upon the town. This did; they
celebrated Culloden.”<a name="FNanchor_582_583" id="FNanchor_582_583"></a><a href="#Footnote_582_583" class="fnanchor">[582]</a></p>

<p>The old town had witnessed a strange sight in the first days
after the battle. The soldiers had held a fair for the sale of the
plunder which they had made. “The traffic on the Rialto Bridge
was nothing in comparison to the business done by our military
merchants; here being great sortments of all manner of plaids,
broad-swords, dirks and pistols, and plaid-waistcoats, officers’ laced
waistcoats, hats, bonnets, blankets, and oatmeal bags.”<a name="FNanchor_583_584" id="FNanchor_583_584"></a><a href="#Footnote_583_584" class="fnanchor">[583]</a> The
severity that was so long exercised by government at length sank
into neglect. Only five years before the arrival of our travellers
all the prisoners, just before the opening of the Assize, made their
escape from the town jail; “so the Lord Pitfour,” a writer to
the Signet wrote, “will have the trouble only of fugitation and
reprimanding the magistrates.”<a name="FNanchor_584_585" id="FNanchor_584_585"></a><a href="#Footnote_584_585" class="fnanchor">[584]</a> How miserable the jail was is
shown in a memorial from the Town Council, dated March 17,
1786, stating that “it consists only of two small cells for criminals,
and one miserable room for civil debtors. Their situation is truly
deplorable, as there are at present and generally about thirty
persons confined in these holes, none of which is above thirteen
feet square.”<a name="FNanchor_585_586" id="FNanchor_585_586"></a><a href="#Footnote_585_586" class="fnanchor">[585]</a> While the poor prisoners were so cruelly treated,
the lawyers had a merry time of it every time that so hospitable
a judge as Boswell’s father came the circuit:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lord Auchinleck made a most respectable figure at the head of his circuit
table. It was his rule to spend every shilling of his allowance for the circuit&mdash;a
thing less to be expected that in everything else he was supposed to be abundantly
economical. He had a plentiful table. He laughed much at the rule laid down
by some of his brethren of asking gentlemen but once to dinner. ‘It is,’ said he,
‘treating them like beggars at a burial, who get their alms in rotation.’”<a name="FNanchor_586_587" id="FNanchor_586_587"></a><a href="#Footnote_586_587" class="fnanchor">[586]</a></p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">{147}</a></span></p>

<p>We are not surprised that Boswell found that “everybody at
Inverness spoke of Lord Auchinleck with uncommon regard.”</p>

<p>The English chapel, which Johnson describes as “meanly built,
but with a very decent congregation,” was pulled down many years
ago. On its site, in the midst of the same old graveyard, another
building has been raised in what may be perhaps called the church-warden
style. Of Macbeth’s castle&mdash;“what is called the castle of
Macbeth,” writes Johnson with his usual caution&mdash;nothing remains.
If we may trust Boswell, “it perfectly corresponded with Shakespeare’s
description.” It has been replaced by “a modern
building of chaste castellated design,” to borrow the language of
the guide-book. I was told, however, that our travellers had been
misinformed, and that “the old original Macbeth’s castle” stood on
a height a little distance from the town. This “pleasant seat” has
been treated, I found, even worse than its rival; for a builder,
thinking that the air “might nimbly and sweetly recommend itself”
to the public as well as to a king, began the erection of a crescent.
Owing to a difficulty about a right of way, the speculation hitherto
has not been so successful as might have been feared.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ENTRANCE TO THE HIGHLANDS.</div>

<p>At Inverness the Lowland life came to an end. To the west
of that town no road had ever been made till some years after the
rising of 1715. All beyond was the work of General Wade and
the other military engineers. “Here,” writes Johnson, “the
appearance of life began to alter. I had seen a few women with
plaids at Aberdeen, but at Inverness the Highland manners are
common. There is, I think, a kirk in which only the Erse
language is used.” The plaid, which was not peculiar to the
Highlands, had been rapidly going out of fashion. Ramsay of
Ochtertyre says that in 1747, when he first knew Edinburgh, nine-tenths
of the ladies still wore them. Five years later “one could
hardly see a lady in that piece of dress. In the course of seven or
eight years the very servant girls were ashamed of being seen in
that ugly antiquated garb.”<a name="FNanchor_587_588" id="FNanchor_587_588"></a><a href="#Footnote_587_588" class="fnanchor">[587]</a> The Gaelic language does not seem
to have lost much ground in Inverness, for I was told that there
are five churches in which it is used every Sunday at one of the
services.</p>

<div class="sidenote">WANT OF ROADS.</div>

<p>At Inverness Johnson bade farewell to post-chaises, which had
brought him in comfort all the way from London. “This day,”
writes Boswell, “we were to begin our <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">equitation</i>, as I said; for I
would needs make a word too. We might have taken a chaise to
Fort Augustus, but had we not hired horses at Inverness we should
not have found them afterwards. We had three horses for Dr.
Johnson, myself, and
Joseph, and one which
carried our portmanteaus,
and two Highlanders
who walked
along with us.” They
took but little baggage,
and soon found
the advantage of their
moderation “in climbing
crags and treading
bogs. How often,”
continues Johnson, “a
man that has pleased
himself at home with
his own resolution,
will in the hour of
darkness and fatigue be content to leave behind him everything but
himself.” After leaving the Fort they were “to enter upon a country
upon which perhaps no wheel had ever rolled.” In the Commercial
Map of Scotland, published by J. Knox in 1784, there is not a single
road marked in any one of the Hebrides. After long wanderings, and
the lapse of almost seven weeks, “Johnson’s heart was cheered by the
sight of a road marked with cart-wheels as on the mainland, a thing
which we had not seen for a long time. It gave us a pleasure similar
to that which a traveller feels when, whilst wandering on what he
fears is a desert island, he perceives the print of human feet.” It
was in pleasant weather that they began their ride. <span class="sidenote">THE SHORES OF LOCH NESS.</span> “The day
though bright was not hot. On the left were high and steep rocks<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_149" id="Page_149">{149}</a></span>
shaded with birch and covered with fern or heath. On the right
the limpid waters of Loch Ness were beating their bank and waving
their surface by a gentle agitation.” In one part of the way, adds
Johnson, “we had trees on both sides for perhaps half a mile. Such
a length of shade, perhaps, Scotland cannot show in any other
place.” Boswell, though he thought Fleet Street more delightful
than Tempe, nevertheless felt the cheering powers of this delightful
day. “The scene” he found “as sequestered and agreeably wild
as could be desired.” Pennant, who had been there four years
earlier, describes the scenery as “most romantic and beautiful.”<a name="FNanchor_588_589" id="FNanchor_588_589"></a><a href="#Footnote_588_589" class="fnanchor">[588]</a>
Wesley thought the neighbourhood of Inverness one of the
pleasantest countries he had ever seen.<a name="FNanchor_589_590" id="FNanchor_589_590"></a><a href="#Footnote_589_590" class="fnanchor">[589]</a> In striking contrast with
the enjoyment of these four travellers are the feelings of those who
a few years before had seen the spot when the alarms of war were
still fresh. “On each side of Loch Ness,” writes Ray, “is a ridge
of most terrible barren woody mountains. You travel along the
banks through a road made by blowing up monstrous rocks, which<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_150" id="Page_150">{150}</a></span>
in many places hang declining over passengers and higher than
houses, so that ’tis frightful to pass by them.”<a name="FNanchor_590_591" id="FNanchor_590_591"></a><a href="#Footnote_590_591" class="fnanchor">[590]</a> <cite>A Volunteer</cite> describes
the mountains “as high and frightful as the Alps in Spain;
so we had nothing pleasant to behold but the sky.”<a name="FNanchor_591_592" id="FNanchor_591_592"></a><a href="#Footnote_591_592" class="fnanchor">[591]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE GENERAL’S HUT.</div>

<p>Our travellers halted for dinner at the General’s Hut, a small
public-house nearly eighteen miles from Inverness.<a name="FNanchor_592_593" id="FNanchor_592_593"></a><a href="#Footnote_592_593" class="fnanchor">[592]</a> Here, says
Johnson, Wade had lodged “while he superintended the works
upon the road.” I have seen it stated in a guide-book that on its
site is built the Foyer’s Hotel, but this is a mistake. In the <cite>Map
of the King’s Roads made by General Wade</cite>, dated 1746, “the
General Hutt” (<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>) is marked just where the road takes a sudden
bend to the south, a short distance after which it passes the church
of Burlassig. Dr. Garnett, who travelled through the Highlands
at the end of the century, says that “the present public-house,
which is still called the General’s Hut, is very near the place where
Wade had a small house, which was afterwards used as an inn. It
commands a delightful view up the lake.” The change of site must
have been made, it would seem, between his visit and Johnson’s.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_151" id="Page_151">{151}</a></span>
The old inn was on the north-east or Inverness side of the church,
whereas the Foyers Hotel is a little distance beyond it to the south-west.
It is a pity that the ambition of landlords has not allowed
the old name to remain. It was the only thing I found wanting in
this comfortable hotel. Sir Walter Scott was surprised that “when
these roads were made there was no care taken for inns. The
King’s House and the General’s Hut are miserable places,” he
adds, “but the project and plans were purely military.”<a name="FNanchor_593_594" id="FNanchor_593_594"></a><a href="#Footnote_593_594" class="fnanchor">[593]</a> Johnson,
however, was not dissatisfied with his entertainment. “We found,”
he says, “the house not ill-stocked with provisions. We had eggs
and bacon, and mutton, with wine, rum, and whisky. I had water.”
The little church hard by Boswell describes as “the meanest parish
kirk I ever saw. It is a shame it should be on a high road.” It
might have been pleaded, perhaps, as an alleviation of its disgrace,
that the high road had come to it and that it had not come to the
high road. His reproach seems to have had some effect, for it has
been removed to another place. The ruins, however, still remain.
A middle-aged woman who dwells in the neighbourhood told me
that “there was an old man living when she first came, who said
he did not mind when it was a church, but his father did.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FALLS OF FOYERS.</div>

<p>While Boswell mentions the mean kirk, with his indifference to
natural objects he passes over in silence the celebrated Falls of
Fiers or Foyers. He does not even mention the bridge over the
river, or the rocks which on three sides of it rise to a great height.
Here Johnson’s imagination was deeply impressed, for he describes
them as “exhibiting a kind of dreadful magnificence; standing like
the barriers of nature placed to keep different orders of being in
perpetual separation.” Dismounting from their horses, “we
clambered,” he writes, “over very rugged crags, till we came at
last to a place where we could overlook the river, and saw a
channel torn, as it seems, through black piles of stone, by which
the stream is obstructed and broken, till it comes to a very steep
descent, of such dreadful depth, that we were naturally inclined to
turn aside our eyes. But we visited the place at an unseasonable
time, and found it divested of its dignity and terror. Nature never
gives everything at once. A long continuance of dry weather,
which made the rest of the way easy and delightful, deprived us of
the pleasure expected from the Falls of Fiers.” This same month
Mason, the poet, was complaining that the cascades at Lodore had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">{152}</a></span>
been “reduced by the dry season to a scanty rill, which took away
more than half the beauties of the scene.”<a name="FNanchor_594_595" id="FNanchor_594_595"></a><a href="#Footnote_594_595" class="fnanchor">[594]</a></p>

for the governor invited them to sleep in his house. Of the fort,
the rebels had made a bonfire on April 15, 1746, the day before
Culloden, “to celebrate the Duke of Cumberland’s birthday.”<a name="FNanchor_595_596" id="FNanchor_595_596"></a><a href="#Footnote_595_596" class="fnanchor">[595]</a> It
had since been rebuilt and greatly strengthened, “being surrounded
by two trenches filled with water, and having draw-bridges, strong
walls, and bastions.”<a name="FNanchor_596_597" id="FNanchor_596_597"></a><a href="#Footnote_596_597" class="fnanchor">[596]</a> Nothing is left of it. Where rough soldiers
once carried things with a high hand, now smooth priests rule. On
the site of the old fortifications which bore the second name of the
butcher duke has been raised a college and monastery dedicated to
St. Benedict. Johnson long remembered the rest which he enjoyed
in the governor’s hospitable home. Nearly four years later he recorded
in his diary: “I passed the night in such sweet uninterrupted
sleep as I have not known since I slept at Fort Augustus.”
The following year, writing to Boswell, he said, “The best night
that I have had these twenty years was at Fort Augustus.” From<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_153" id="Page_153">{153}</a></span>
this spot to the sea-shore opposite Skye they had about forty-four
miles of highland paths to traverse. This part of their journey
they were forced to divide very unequally, as Anoch, the only
place where they could find entertainment, was scarcely a third of
the way. <span class="sidenote">GLENMORISON.</span> Crossing the mountains by a road which had been made
“with labour that might have broken the perseverance of a Roman
legion,” early in the afternoon they came “through a wild country”
to Glenmorison.<a name="FNanchor_597_598" id="FNanchor_597_598"></a><a href="#Footnote_597_598" class="fnanchor">[597]</a> They did not, as the guide-book says, follow the
course of the river Moriston from Invermoriston, but joined it some
miles higher up, above the fine scenery and the wild tumble of
water which are shown in the accompanying sketch. This fact I
did not discover till too late. Anoch Johnson describes as “standing
in a glen or valley
pleasantly watered by
a winding river. It
consists of three huts,
one of which is distinguished
by a chimney.”
It was in the house
thus distinguished that
they lodged. When I
visited this spot last
summer, we halted at
a farmhouse hard by
to rest our horses and
take some lunch. We sat on the bank of a dried-up brook,
beneath a row of witch-elms. A cuckoo was flying about, resting
now and then on the garden wall. “Its two-fold shout” it
scarcely uttered, thinking, perhaps, that as it was the month of
June, it would be “heard, not regarded.” The wind rustled in
the leaves, the river, blue beneath a blue sky, ran swiftly by, now
under a shady bank, and now round a stony foreland, till it lost
itself at last from our sight behind a bend. To the west rose lofty
mountains; on the other side of the valley were sloping hills. We
lunched on frothing milk, oat-cakes, scones, and butter; the sheep
dogs playing around us, and with wistful gaze asking for their
share of the feast. We lay on the ground and looked across the little
ravine at an old hut that was “distinguished by a chimney.” This<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">{154}</a></span>
we all voted, and very likely with truth on our side, was the
very place where our travellers had lodged. Talking of “far-off
things,” of Johnson and the copy of Cocker’s Arithmetic which he
gave to his landlord’s “gentle and pleasing daughter,” of her father’s
library of odd volumes, and of the old hut and the old life, an hour
slipped quickly and pleasantly by.</p>

<p>As our travellers “passed on through the dreariness of solitude”
on their way hither, they had come upon a party of soldiers working
on the road, to whom they gave a couple of shillings to spend
in drink. “With the true military impatience of coin in their
pockets,” these men had followed them to the inn, “having marched
at least six miles to find the first place where liquor could be
bought.” There they made merry in the barn. “We went and
paid them a visit,” writes Boswell; “Dr. Johnson saying, ‘Come,
let’s go and give ’em another shilling
a-piece.’ We did so, and he
was saluted ‘My Lord’ by all of
them.” Johnson avows that one
cause of his generosity was regard
to his and Boswell’s safety.
“Having never been before in a
place so wild and unfrequented, I
was glad of their arrival, because
I knew that we had made them
friends; and to gain still more of their good-will, we went to them
when they were carousing in the barn, and added something to our
former gift.” The money was ill-bestowed. “The poor soldiers
got too much liquor. Some of them fought and left blood upon
the spot, and cursed whisky next morning.” Perhaps Johnson had
them in his mind when, a few years later, he said, “Why, sir, a
common soldier is usually a very gross man.” To the degradation
of one of the English regiments which had been stationed in the
Highlands, testimony is borne by Wolfe, who on his return from
Scotland in 1753, wrote: “If I stay much longer with the regiment
I shall be perfectly corrupt; the officers are loose and profligate,
and the soldiers are very devils.”<a name="FNanchor_598_599" id="FNanchor_598_599"></a><a href="#Footnote_598_599" class="fnanchor">[598]</a> Johnson soon found that he had
no need of a guard. His host had indeed fought in the Highland
army at Culloden, but he was a quiet honest fellow. The account
which he gave of the campaign moved Boswell to tears. If he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_155" id="Page_155">{155}</a></span>
told them the following story which I have found in Henderson’s
<cite>History of the Rebellion</cite>, he would have moved also Johnson to
anger. <span class="sidenote">THE GRANTS OF GLENMORISON.</span> A party of the Grants of Glenmorison had joined the
Pretender’s army at Edinburgh. The laird, who had remained
loyal, came, after the battle of Culloden, “with about five hundred
of his vassals to Inverness, whence they were sent into the country
of the Macintoshes. Hereupon the Grants in the rebellion begged
his intercession. He repaired to the Duke of Cumberland, and
said, ‘Here are a number of men come in with their arms, who
would have submitted to none in Britain but to me.’ ‘No!’
answered the duke; ‘I’ll let them know that they are my father’s
subjects, and must likewise submit to me.’ So he gave orders to
embark them with the other prisoners, and they were shipped off
to Tilbury Fort.”<a name="FNanchor_599_600" id="FNanchor_599_600"></a><a href="#Footnote_599_600" class="fnanchor">[599]</a> Smollett tells how great numbers of the miserable
captives who were sent to London by sea, being crowded in
the holds of the vessels, “perished in the most deplorable manner
for want of necessaries, air, and exercise.”<a name="FNanchor_600_601" id="FNanchor_600_601"></a><a href="#Footnote_600_601" class="fnanchor">[600]</a> If the Grants escaped
this fate, very likely they were transported to America.</p>

<p>It was a long and heavy journey that this day lay before our
travellers, so that they rose in good time and started about eight
o’clock. Boswell, who had awakened very early, had been a little
scared by the thought that “their landlord, being about to emigrate,
might murder them to get their money, and lay it upon the
soldiers in the barn.” “When I got up,” he adds, “I found Dr.
Johnson asleep in his miserable stye, as I may call it, with a
coloured handkerchief round his head. With difficulty could I
awaken him.” So miserable had their beds looked that “we had
some difficulty,” writes Johnson, “in persuading ourselves to lie
down in them. At last we ventured, and I slept very soundly in
the vale of Glenmorison amidst the rocks and mountains.” The
road which they were to follow is but little traversed at the present
day, for tourists either keep to the south by the Caledonian Canal,
or to the north by the railway to Strome Ferry. <span class="sidenote">THE HAPPY VALLEY.</span> They thereby
miss, to use Boswell’s words, “a scene of as wild nature as one<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_156" id="Page_156">{156}</a></span>
could see.” To this part of my tour I had long looked forward.
It is many a year since I first formed the wish to visit that
“narrow valley not very flowery, but sufficiently verdant,” where
Johnson planned the history of his tour.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sat down on a bank (he says) such as a writer of romance might have
delighted to feign. I had indeed no trees to whisper over my head, but a clear
rivulet streamed at my feet. The day was calm, the air was soft, and all was rudeness,
silence, and solitude. Before me and on either side were high hills, which by
hindering the eye from ranging, forced the mind to find entertainment for itself.
Whether I spent the hour well I know not, for here I first conceived the thought of
this narration.”</p></div>

<p>In a letter to Mrs. Thrale he describes the same scene, but
makes no mention of the book which he had in mind.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I sat down to take notes on a green bank, with a small stream running at my
feet, in the midst of savage solitude, with mountains before me, and on either hand
covered with heath. I looked around me, and wondered that I was not more
affected, but the mind is not at all times equally ready to be put in motion. If my
mistress and master, and Queeney<a name="FNanchor_601_602" id="FNanchor_601_602"></a><a href="#Footnote_601_602" class="fnanchor">[601]</a> had been there, we should have produced
some reflections among us either poetical or philosophical, for though solitude be
the nurse of woe,<a name="FNanchor_602_603" id="FNanchor_602_603"></a><a href="#Footnote_602_603" class="fnanchor">[602]</a> conversation is often the parent of remarks and discoveries.”</p></div>

<p>My hopes of finding this classical rivulet were great. A kind
correspondent, the Rev. Alexander Matheson, minister of Glen
Shiel, had been told by some old people of the neighbourhood that
they knew by tradition the exact spot. Though he had nearly
twenty miles to come, he undertook to show me it. I arrived at
the little inn at Clunie earlier than he had expected, and there
meeting him found to my disappointment that I had passed the
spot some six or seven miles. Both horses and travellers were too
weary to retrace their steps. The tradition of the old people had
on further investigation proved to be worthless. Like myself he
had been at first misled by Boswell’s narrative, which places
this happy valley at the western end of Glen Shiel. But on
looking at Johnson’s account, aided too by his own knowledge of
the locality, he had detected the error. The rivulet by which they
had made their noonday halt must have been in Glen Clunie, near
the eastern end of the loch, for Johnson describes how after their
rest “they continued their journey along the side of a loch which
at last ended in a river broad and shallow. Beyond it is a valley
called Glen Shiel.” For my disappointment there was some consolation<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_157" id="Page_157">{157}</a></span>
to be found. The long drought of nearly two months
which had preceded my tour had dried up those rivulets which
Johnson crossed, running, as he describes them, “with a clear,
shallow stream over a
hard, pebbly bottom.”
The main river had
still water in it; but
we saw few indeed of
“the streams rushing
down the steep” which
fed it. In that part
of the narrow valley
where he reposed we
should have had only
a choice of dried-up
watercourses, had we
tried to select the
bank on which he sat. <span class="sidenote">YARROW UNVISITED.</span> For me Yarrow still

<p>Passing through
Glen Clunie, which
now boasts of a little
inn where the traveller
can find clean, if
homely lodgings, they
reached Glen Shiel.
It is worth notice that though the word <em>Glen</em> is in Johnson’s
Dictionary, so unfamiliar was it at this time to English ears, that
using it in the letter in which he describes this day’s journey,
he adds, “so they call a valley.” In Glen Shiel, writes Boswell,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">{158}</a></span>
they saw “where the battle was fought in 1719.” It was in the
second and last of the Spanish invasions of our island that
this fight took place. An armament of ten ships of war and
transports, having on board 6,000 regular troops with arms for
12,000 men, had sailed from Cadiz under the command of the
Duke of Ormond, in the hope of restoring the Stuarts to that
throne which they had forfeited by their tyranny and their folly.
The winds and waves fought for us, as they had fought long
before in the time of the Great Armada. Two ships only succeeded
in reaching the coast of Scotland. <span class="sidenote">EILAN DONAN CASTLE.</span> They landed their
troops near Eilan Donan Castle on Loch Duich, the seat of the
chief of the Mackenzies. Four years earlier the fighting men of
this clan had gone off to join the forces of the Earl of Mar, and
had taken part in the battle of Sheriffmuir. The grandfather of
the present minister of the parish in which Eilan Donan stands,
had known an aged parishioner, who had seen the clansmen dance
on the leads of the castle the evening before they started on their
expedition. There were among them four chieftains, each bearing
the name of John, and known as “the four Johns of Scotland.”
They all danced at Eilan Donan, and all fell at Sheriffmuir. <span class="sidenote">BATTLE OF GLEN SHIEL.</span>I was
told also of a tradition which still exists among the people, that at
Glen Shiel the clansmen had sent their women and children to
wave flags on the hills as if they were a fresh body of men.
Deceived by this appearance, the regular troops had at first
retreated. The battle with the Spaniards was fought at a spot,
where on both sides the mountains draw close, and the valley<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_159" id="Page_159">{159}</a></span>
narrows to a ravine through which the river when swollen by the
rains rushes foaming along in fine cascades. Along the right bank
the rocks were so steep that till the present road was cut no passage
was possible; on the left bank there was a narrow opening
beneath a precipitous crag. A little above the uppermost of the
waterfalls the country folks still point out “the black colonel’s
grave”&mdash;some swarthy Spaniard, perhaps, who fell that day far
from the cork-groves of Southern Spain. They tell too how the
Spanish soldiers who surrendered themselves as prisoners of war
first cast their arms into the deep pool below. A dreadful story
has been recorded by an Englishman who lived for many years at
Inverness. “He had been assured,” he writes, “by several
officers who were in the battle, that some of the English soldiers
who were dangerously wounded were left behind for three or
four hours. When parties were sent to them with hurdles made
to serve as litters, they were all found stabbed with dirks in twenty
places.”<a name="FNanchor_603_604" id="FNanchor_603_604"></a><a href="#Footnote_603_604" class="fnanchor">[603]</a> The story may not be true. If it is, the clansmen were
as savage after Glen Shiel, as were the regular troops twenty-seven
years later after Culloden.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MOUNTAIN LIKE A CONE.</div>

<p>In the warm sunshine of a day in June we sat on a bank above
the dark pool beneath whose eddying waters some of the arms
perhaps still lie. There was a gentle breeze, the larks were singing
over our heads, the water was sparkling and splashing, the sides of
the torrent were overhung with the mountain ash and were green
with ferns, but below us and in front lay a scene of wild desolation.
Far off to the west was the mountain which Boswell had pointed
out to Johnson as being like a cone. “No, Sir,” said Johnson.
“It would be called so in a book, and when a man comes to look
at it, he sees it is not so. It is indeed pointed at the top; but one
side of it is larger than the other.” Its Gaelic name, <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Faochag</i>,
which signifies <em>whelk</em>, shows that though Johnson’s objection may
have been a proof of his “perceptive quickness,” yet Boswell’s
description was quite accurate enough for two men out on a tour.
We tried in vain to distinguish which among the mountains was “the
considerable protuberance.” Perhaps the Johnson Club may not
disdain to appoint a committee who shall be instructed to bid farewell
for a time to the delights of Fleet Street and visit Glen Shiel,
with full powers to come to a final decision in this important matter.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_161" id="Page_161">{161}</a></span>
A long drive down the steep pass brought us to the place which
Boswell said was “a rich green valley, comparatively speaking.” <span class="sidenote">AUCHNASHEAL.</span>A little way beyond it lay the twenty huts which formed the
village of Auchnasheal. “One of them,” says Johnson, “was built
of loose stones, piled up with great thickness into a strong, though
not solid wall. From this house we obtained some great pails of
milk, and having brought bread with us were very liberally regaled.”
The curious scene which they witnessed here is thus described by
Boswell:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We sat down on a green turf-seat at the end of a house; they brought us out
two wooden dishes of milk,<a name="FNanchor_604_605" id="FNanchor_604_605"></a><a href="#Footnote_604_605" class="fnanchor">[604]</a> which we tasted. One of them was frothed like a
syllabub. I saw a woman preparing it with such a stick as is used for chocolate,
and in the same manner. We had a considerable circle about us, men, women,
and children, all M’Craas, Lord Seaforth’s people. Not one of them could speak
English. I observed to Dr. Johnson, it was much the same as being with a tribe
of Indians. Johnson: ‘Yes, sir, but not so terrifying.’ I gave all who chose it
snuff and tobacco. Governor Trapaud had made us buy a quantity at Fort
Augustus, and put them up in small parcels. I also gave each person a piece of
wheat bread, which they had never tasted before. I then gave a penny apiece to
each child. I told Dr. Johnson of this: upon which he called to Joseph and our
guides, for change for a shilling, and declared that he would distribute among the
children. Upon this being announced in Erse, there was a great stir: not only did
some children come running down from neighbouring huts, but I observed one
black-haired man, who had been with us all along, had gone off, and returned,
bringing a very young child. My fellow-traveller then ordered the children to be
drawn up in a row, and he dealt about his copper, and made them and their
parents all happy.”</p></div>

<p>“It was the best day the McCraas declared they had seen since
the time of the old laird of Macleod.” He, no doubt, had made a
halt in their valley on his way to or from Skye. The snuff and
tobacco must have won their hearts more even than the money.
“Nothing,” Johnson was told, “gratified the Highlanders so
much.” Knox recorded a few years later that “any stranger who
cannot take a pinch of snuff or give one is looked upon with an
evil eye.”<a name="FNanchor_605_606" id="FNanchor_605_606"></a><a href="#Footnote_605_606" class="fnanchor">[605]</a> So uncommon was wheaten bread even a quarter of a
century later, that Dr. Garnett, after leaving Inverary, tasted none
till he reached Inverness.<a name="FNanchor_606_607" id="FNanchor_606_607"></a><a href="#Footnote_606_607" class="fnanchor">[606]</a> At present it can be had in most places,
being brought by the steamers in large boxes from Glasgow, and
transported inland in the country carts. The way in which the
villagers had gathered round the travellers had startled even<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_162" id="Page_162">{162}</a></span>
Johnson, stout-hearted though he was. “I believe,” he says,
“they were without any evil intention, but they had a very savage
wildness of aspect and manner.” My friend, the minister of Glen
Shiel, pointed out to me that it was no doubt mere curiosity which
brought them round him. Johnson was as strange a sight to them
as they were to Johnson. An earlier traveller in the Hebrides
has expressed this very well. “Every man and thing I met with,”
he writes, “seemed a novelty. I thought myself entering upon a
new scene of nature, but nature rough and unpolished. Men,
manners, habits, buildings, everything different from our own; and
if we thought them rude and barbarous, no doubt the people had
the same opinion of what belonged to us, and the wonder was
mutual.”<a name="FNanchor_607_608" id="FNanchor_607_608"></a><a href="#Footnote_607_608" class="fnanchor">[607]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SHEEP INSTEAD OF MEN.</div>

<p>Auchnasheal has been swept away; nothing of it is left but a
few banks of earth and the foundations of the one stone house.
The same fate has befallen it which befell that other village near
Fort Augustus where Coleridge heard a Highland widow mourn
over the desolation of the land:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“‘Within this space,’ she said, ‘how short a time back!&mdash;there lived a hundred
and seventy-three persons, and now there is only a shepherd and an underling or
two. Yes, Sir! One hundred and seventy-three Christian souls, man, woman, boy,
girl, and babe, and in almost every home an old man by the fire-side, who would
tell you of the troubles before our roads were made; and many a brave youth
among them who loved the birthplace of his forefathers, yet would swing about his
broad-sword, and want but a word to march off to the battles over sea; aye, Sir,
and many a good lass who had a respect for herself. Well, but they are gone, and
with them the bristled bear [barley] and the pink haver [oats], and the potato plot
that looked as gay as any flower-garden with its blossoms! I sometimes fancy that
the very birds are gone&mdash;all but the crows and the gleads [kites]. Well, and what
then? Instead of us all, there is one shepherd man, and it may be a pair of small
lads&mdash;and a many, many sheep! And do you think, Sir, that God allows of such
proceedings?’”<a name="FNanchor_608_609" id="FNanchor_608_609"></a><a href="#Footnote_608_609" class="fnanchor">[608]</a></p></div>

<p>The desolation had already begun even at the time of our travellers’
visit. Their host of the evening before was following seventy of
the dalesmen to America, whither they had been driven by a
rack-renting landlord. “I asked him,” writes Johnson, “whether
they would stay at home if they were well-treated. He answered
with indignation, that no man willingly left his native country.”</p>

<p>Taking leave of these inoffensive, if wild-looking people, our
travellers rode on, much refreshed by their repast. They had, as
Johnson complained, “very little entertainment, as they travelled<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_163" id="Page_163">{163}</a></span>
either for the eye or ear. There are, I fancy,” he adds, “no singing
birds in the Highlands.” It is odd that he should have looked
for singing-birds on the 1st of September. Had it been earlier in
the summer he would have found melody enough. Nowhere have
I heard the thrushes sing more sweetly than at Glenelg. Wesley,
visiting Inverness on an early day of May, “heard abundance of
birds welcoming the return of spring.”<a name="FNanchor_609_610" id="FNanchor_609_610"></a><a href="#Footnote_609_610" class="fnanchor">[609]</a> If so late in the summer
there was no music for the ear, the eye surely should have been
something more than entertained, when in the evening light the
first sight was caught of Loch Duich and the waters of the Atlantic,
and the barrier of mountains which so nobly encloses them. Yet
they are passed over in silence by both our travellers. So fine is
the scenery here that I longed to make a stay in the comfortable
inn at Shiel, near the head of the loch. <span class="sidenote">SHEEP-SHEARING IN SHIEL.</span> But we were forced to
press on, having first witnessed, however, sheep-shearing on a large
scale on a farm close by. In front of a storing-house for wool
fifteen men were seated all hard at work with their shears, their
dogs lying at their feet. They wore coloured jerseys in which the
shades of blue and green were all the pleasanter to the eye because
they were somewhat faded. Young lads were bringing up the
sheep from the fold. The forelegs of each animal were tied, it was
then lifted on to a narrow bank of turf which had been raised in
front of each shepherd, thrown on its back, and in a moment the
busy shears were at work. In the long summer day a quick hand
could finish eighty, we were told. As soon as the fleece fell loose,
an old woman came forward, folded it up tight, and carried it into
the store-house; while a boy, dipping the branding-iron into boiling
pitch, scored the side of each sheep with a deep black mark. From
time to time the farmer went round with a bottle and a small glass,
and gave each man a dram of pure whisky. Not far from here on
the banks of the loch was an old house where it was said that
Johnson made a halt. It is so pleasant a place, with its grove of
trees and its garden of roses, and so kindly was I welcomed, that I
would willingly believe the tradition. I could wish, however, that
he and Boswell had not treated it with the same neglect as they
did the view. Had their reception been as kind as mine they
would certainly have expressed their gratitude. <span class="sidenote">MAM RATTAKIN.</span> It was here
that I was told of the address which he made to the mountain at
the foot of which the house stands, and up which he was now to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_164" id="Page_164">{164}</a></span>
climb, “Good-bye, Mam Rattakin, I hope never to see your face
again.”<a name="FNanchor_610_611" id="FNanchor_610_611"></a><a href="#Footnote_610_611" class="fnanchor">[610]</a> They did not reach it till late in the afternoon. Both
Johnson and the horses were weary, and they had “a terrible steep
to climb.” Going down was almost worse than going up, for his
horse now and then stumbled beneath his great weight. On the
edge of one of the precipices he was, he thought, in real danger.
He grew fretful with fatigue, and was not comforted by the absurd
attempt made by his guide to amuse him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Having heard him, in the forenoon, express a pastoral pleasure on seeing the
goats browsing, just when the doctor was uttering his displeasure, the fellow cried,
with a very Highland accent, ‘See, such pretty goats!’ Then he whistled <em>whu!</em>
and made them jump. Little did he conceive what Dr. Johnson was. Here now
was a common ignorant Highland clown imagining that he could divert, as one does
a child, <em>Dr. Samuel Johnson!</em> The ludicrousness, absurdity, and extraordinary contrast
between what the fellow fancied, and the reality, was truly comic.”</p></div>

<p>At the bottom of the mountain a dreary ride of six or seven
long miles through a flat and uninteresting country still awaited
them. They were too tired even for talk. Boswell urged on his
horse so that some preparation might be made for the great man
at the inn at Glenelg.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He called me back,” he writes, “with a tremendous shout, and was really in a
passion with me for leaving him. I told him my intentions, but he was not satisfied,
and said, ‘Do you know, I should as soon have thought of picking a pocket, as doing
so.’ <span class="smcap">Boswell.</span> ‘I am diverted with you, Sir.’ <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> ‘Sir, I could never be
diverted with incivility. Doing such a thing makes one lose confidence in him who
has done it, as one cannot tell what he may do next.’”</p></div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Even after he had reached the inn his violence continued. “Sir,”
he said, “had you gone on, I was thinking that I should have
returned with you to Edinburgh, and then have parted from you,
and never spoken to you more.” The next morning “he owned
that he had spoken in passion; that he would not have done what
he threatened; and that if he had, he should have been ten times
worse than I; and he added, ‘Let’s think no more on’t.’” As we
drove down the mountain on a summer afternoon the peacefulness
of the pastoral scene, the sheep dotted about quietly nibbling the
grass, with their lambs by their side, the hazy air on the hills, all
seemed to contrast strangely with the violence of his passion. To
an old man, however, tired with a long day’s ride over rough ways,
and in want of his dinner, something must be forgiven. He is not<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_165" id="Page_165">{165}</a></span>
the only tourist who, in his need of rest and food, has relieved his
feelings by quarrelling with his companion.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BERNERA BARRACKS.</div>

<p>When they were not far from the end of their ride they passed
the barracks at Bernera. “I looked at them wistfully,” writes
Boswell; “as soldiers have always everything in the best order;
but there was only a sergeant and a few men there.” Pennant,
who had visited them a year earlier, describes them as “handsome
and capacious, designed to hold two hundred men; at present
occupied only by a corporal and six soldiers. The country lament
this neglect. They are now quite sensible of the good effects of
the military, by introducing peace and security; they fear lest the
evil days should return, and the ancient thefts be renewed as soon
as the banditti find this protection of the people removed.”<a name="FNanchor_611_612" id="FNanchor_611_612"></a><a href="#Footnote_611_612" class="fnanchor">[611]</a> The
banditti were the Highlanders of this district in general. Less than
thirty years earlier “the whole country between Loch Ness and
the sea to the west had been,” he says, “a den of thieves. The
constant petition at grace of the old Highland chieftains was
delivered with great fervour in these terms: ‘Lord, turn the world
upside down, that Christians may make bread out of it.’”<a name="FNanchor_612_613" id="FNanchor_612_613"></a><a href="#Footnote_612_613" class="fnanchor">[612]</a></p>

<p>The country had to lament a loss of trade as well as of security.
The cottagers who had been drawn together to supply the wants
of the soldiers are described by Knox, a few years later, as being
in the utmost poverty. The barracks had fallen into so ruinous a
state, that it justified the report that the building of them had been
“a notorious job.” Even the sergeant and his six soldiers had
been removed. “I was entertained,” says Knox, “by the commanding
officer and his whole garrison. The former was an old
corporal, and the latter was the corporal’s wife: the entertainment
snuff and whisky.”<a name="FNanchor_613_614" id="FNanchor_613_614"></a><a href="#Footnote_613_614" class="fnanchor">[613]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE INN AT GLENELG.</div>

<p>When at length our travellers, “weary and disgusted,” reached
Glenelg, “our humour,” writes Johnson, “was not much mended
by our inn, which, though it was built of lime and slate, the Highlander’s
description of a house which he thinks magnificent, had
neither wine, bread, eggs, nor anything that we could eat or drink.
When we were taken upstairs a dirty fellow bounced out of the bed
where one of us was to lie. Boswell blustered, but nothing could
be got. At last a gentleman in the neighbourhood, who heard of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_166" id="Page_166">{166}</a></span>
our arrival, sent us rum and white sugar. Boswell was now provided
for in part, and the landlord prepared some mutton chops
which we could not eat, and killed two hens, of which Boswell
made his servant broil a limb, with what effect I know not. We
had a lemon and a piece of bread, which supplied me with my
supper.” Boswell’s account of the place is no less dismal. “There
was no provender for our horses; so they were sent to grass with
a man to watch them. A maid showed us upstairs into a room
damp and dirty, with bare walls, a variety of bad smells, a coarse
black greasy fir table, and forms of the same kind; and out of a
wretched bed started a fellow from his sleep, like Edgar in <cite>King
Lear</cite>, ‘Poor Tom’s a cold.’” Johnson slept in his clothes and great
coat, on a bed of hay; “Boswell laid sheets upon his bed which he
had brought from home, and reposed in linen like a gentleman.”</p>

<div class="caption"><p>SKYE, FROM GLENELG.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Here, again, was I struck by the contrast between the past and
the present. Of the old inn, with all its magnificence of lime and
slate, not even the site is known. In its place stands a roomy and
comfortable hotel. It was on the 21st of June when we visited<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_167" id="Page_167">{167}</a></span>
it, and we found it half-asleep and almost empty, for the season
had not yet begun. At the most delightful time of the year, when
the days were at their longest and no candles were burnt, there was
scarcely a single stranger to enjoy the quiet and the beauty. There
were woods and flowering shrubs, rhododendrons and the Portugal
laurel, and close to the water’s edge the laburnum in full bloom.
There were all the sights of peaceful country life&mdash;the cocks crowing,
the sheep answering with their bleats their bleating lambs, the
cows with their calves in the noonday heat seeking the shade of
the tall and wide-spreading trees. The waves lapped gently on
the shore, and in the distance, below the rocky coast of Skye, the
waters were whitened by the countless sea-birds. We drove up a
beautiful valley to the Pictish forts, and saw an eagle hovering high
above us.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LANDING ON SKYE.</div>

<p>On the morning of Thursday, September 2, our travellers took
boat at Glenelg, “and launched into one of the straits of the
Atlantic Ocean.” Rowing
along the Sound of Slate towards
the south-west, they
reached the shore of Armidale
in Skye early in the
afternoon. They had intended
to visit in his castle
the owner of half the island,
Sir Alexander Macdonald. But, wrote Johnson, “he had come
from his seat in the middle of the island to a small house on
the shore, as we believe, that he might with less reproach entertain
us meanly.” Boswell was so much disgusted with this
chieftain’s parsimony, that he “meditated an escape from his house
the very next day; but Dr. Johnson resolved that we should
weather it out till Monday.” <span class="sidenote">CORRICHATACHIN.</span>When the day of escape at length
came, they started on horseback in a north-westerly direction for
Corrichatachin, a farm-house near Broadford,<a name="FNanchor_614_615" id="FNanchor_614_615"></a><a href="#Footnote_614_615" class="fnanchor">[614]</a> belonging to Sir A.
Macdonald, but tenanted by a Mackinnon, a clan to which all this
district had formerly belonged. “Here they were entertained
better than at the landlord’s;” here “they enjoyed the comfort of a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_168" id="Page_168">{168}</a></span>
table plentifully furnished, and here for the first time they had a
specimen of the joyous social manners of the inhabitants of the
Highlands.” Books, too, were not wanting, both Latin and English;
among them was a copy of the abridgment of Johnson’s Dictionary.
He might have said here, as four years later with some eagerness
he said at Lord Scarsdale’s, when he discovered the same book in
his lordship’s dressing-room, “Quæ regio in terris nostri non plena
laboris?” Here, too, he wrote that Latin Ode to Mrs. Thrale,
which so caught Sir Walter Scott’s imagination, that when he first
set foot on Skye, it was the thing which first came into his
thoughts. And here on their return after a lapse of nearly three
weeks, Boswell got so tipsy and so piously penitent next day. He
had not gone to bed till nearly five o’clock on a Sunday morning,
by which time four bowls of punch had been finished.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I awaked at noon,” he records, “with a severe headache. I was much vexed
that I should have been guilty of such a riot, and afraid of a reproof from Dr.
Johnson. I thought it very inconsistent with that conduct which I ought to
maintain, while the companion of the <cite>Rambler</cite>. About one he came into my room,
and accosted me, ‘What, drunk yet?’ His tone of voice was not that of severe
upbraiding; so I was relieved a little. ‘Sir,’ said I, ‘they kept me up.’ He
answered, ‘No, you kept them up, you drunken dog.’ This he said with good-humoured
English pleasantry. Soon afterwards, Corrichatachin, Col, and other
friends, assembled round my bed. Corri had a brandy-bottle and glass with him,
and insisted I should take a dram. ‘Ay,’ said Dr. Johnson, ‘fill him drunk
again. Do it in the morning, that we may laugh at him all day. It is a poor thing
for a fellow to get drunk at night, and sculk to bed, and let his friends have no
sport.’ Finding him thus jocular, I became quite easy; and when I offered to get
up, he very good-naturedly said, ‘You need be in no such hurry now.’ I took my
host’s advice, and drank some brandy, which I found an effectual cure for my headache.
When I rose, I went into Dr. Johnson’s room, and taking up Mrs. M’Kinnon’s
Prayer-book, I opened it at the Twentieth Sunday after Trinity, in the epistle for
which I read, ‘And be not drunk with wine, wherein there is excess.’ Some
would have taken this as a divine interposition.”</p></div>

<p>Before the afternoon was over, by the help of good cheer and
good society, he felt himself comfortable enough, and his piety was
drowned in philosophy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I then thought,” he says, “that my last night’s riot was no more than such a
social excess as may happen without much moral blame; and recollected that some
physicians maintained, that a fever produced by it was, upon the whole, good for
health.”</p></div>

<p class="floatc">CORRICHATACHIN NEAR BROADFORD SKYE</p>
</div>
</div>

<p>The Highlanders were more seasoned drinkers than he was, for
the following night they had another drinking-bout.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They kept a smart lad lying on a table in the corner of the room, ready to
spring up and bring the kettle whenever it was wanted. They continued drinking,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_169" id="Page_169">{169}</a></span>
and singing Erse songs, till near five in the morning, when they all came into my
room, where some of them had beds. Unluckily for me, they found a bottle of
punch in a corner, which they drank; and Corrichatachin went for another, which
they also drank. They made many apologies for disturbing me. I told them,
that, having been kept awake by their mirth, I had once thoughts of getting up and
joining them again. Honest Corrichatachin said, ‘To have had you done so, I
would have given a cow.’”</p></div>

<p>Johnson was better lodged than Boswell, for he had a room to
himself at night, though in the day it was the place where the
servants took their meals. Yet he was pleased with the kindness
shown him, and discovered no deficiencies. “Our entertainment,”
he wrote, “was not only hospitable but elegant.” The company
he describes as being “more numerous and elegant than it could
have been supposed easy to collect.” He gave as much pleasure
as he received, and when he left, “the Scottish phrase of <em>honest
man</em>, which is an expression of kindness and regard, was again and
again applied to him.”</p>

<p>The house he describes as “very pleasantly situated between
two brooks, with one of the highest hills of the island behind it.”
Boswell with good reason remarks on the entire absence of a
garden. “Corrichatachin,” he writes, “has not even a turnip, a
carrot, or a cabbage.” Where these were wanting, there would be
no roses clustering on the porch, no flower-beds before the door.
This scene of hospitality and jovial riot is now a ruin. We
walked to it from Broadford across a moorland, the curlews flying
round us with their melancholy cry. The two brooks were
shrunk with the long drought, and flowed in very quiet streams.
Yet one of them, I was told, in a time of flood once broke into
Mackinnon’s house. We crossed it on a bridge formed of two
trees, with a long piece of iron wire for a railing. There we rested
awhile, now looking down at the sunlight dancing in the shallows,
and now gazing at the ruined farm and the mountain rising behind
in steep crags of barren rock. Far up the valley to the west a
flock of sheep was coming white from the shearing, bleating as
they spread out along the hill-side. Another flock the dogs were
gathering into what had been the yard of the old house. It had
been solidly built, two stories high, about thirty-six feet long by
fifteen broad in the inside measurements. On the outside, over the
door, was carved:&mdash;</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">{170}</a></span></p>

<p>Johnson’s host was Lachlan Mackinnon, and the initials are, I
suppose, his and his wife’s. It was but a small place to hold the
large and festive company that was gathered at the time of our
traveller’s visit; but, as Boswell says, “it was partly done by
separating man and wife, and putting a number of men in one room
and of women in another.” As I looked up at the windows which
still remain, though the floors have fallen in, I wondered which was
the room which was Johnson’s chamber at night, and the ladies’
parlour by day, where Boswell sat among them writing his journal.</p>

<div class="sidenote">CHANGES IN SKYE.</div>

<p>At the Hotel at Broadford, I was struck by the change that has
come about since Johnson’s time, “in this verge of European life,”
to use the term which he applied to Skye. Corrichatachin remains
almost as he saw it. A house had fallen in ruins and had been
replaced by another, and a small grove of trees had been planted.
A garden had been made, and patches of ground which once were
pasture had been ploughed up. But the broad face of nature is
unchanged. This “region of obscurity,” is, however, obscure no
longer. Where he was nearly ten weeks without receiving letters,
now even the poor, far from their homes, by means of the telegraphic
wire can, as it were, “live along the line.” A maid-servant
who goes to distant services, on her arrival, by means of a
telegram, at once frees her mother from her “heart-struck anxious
care.” The owner of the hotel, from whom I learnt this fact, said
that “Rowland Hill had done more for the poor man than all the
ministers since, and that many of the Highlanders in gratitude had
called their sons after him.”</p>

<h2 class="p2"><a name="Raasay_September_8-12" id="Raasay_September_8-12"><span class="smcap">Raasay (September 8-12).</span></a></h2>

<p>From Corrichatachin our travellers rode down to the sea-side
at Broadford, two miles off, where they took boat for the island of
Raasay. The Macgillichallum, or laird of Raasay, John Macleod,
had politely sent his coach and six, as he called his six-oared boat,
to fetch them over. Though it was “thus dignified with a pompous
name,” writes Johnson, “there was no seat, but an occasional bundle
of straw. I never,” he adds, “saw in the Hebrides a boat furnished
with benches.” In it had come the learned Donald M’Queen, a
minister, and old Malcolm Macleod, who had been out in the ’45,
and had aided the Young Pretender in his escape. <span class="sidenote">THE HIGHLAND DRESS.</span> I had at one
time thought that it was to him that Johnson alludes, when he
speaks of having met one man, and one only, who defied the law
against wearing the Highland dress. “By him,” he adds, “it was
worn only occasionally and wantonly.”<a name="FNanchor_615_616" id="FNanchor_615_616"></a><a href="#Footnote_615_616" class="fnanchor">[615]</a> I now believe, however,
that it was Macdonald of Kingsburgh who was meant. Ever
since the last rebellion the national garb had been suppressed. It
had been enacted that “no person whatsoever should wear or put
on those parts of the Highland clothes, garb, or habiliments which
are called the plaid, philibeg,<a name="FNanchor_616_617" id="FNanchor_616_617"></a><a href="#Footnote_616_617" class="fnanchor">[616]</a> or little kilt, or any of them.” Any
offender “not being a landed man, or the son of a landed man”
shall be tried before a justice of the peace “in a summary way, and
shall be delivered over to serve as a soldier.”<a name="FNanchor_617_618" id="FNanchor_617_618"></a><a href="#Footnote_617_618" class="fnanchor">[617]</a> Even the loyal
Highlanders in the Duke of Cumberland’s army had been compelled
in part to adopt the southern garb. “Near Linlithgow,”
writes Henderson, “the whole army passed in review before their
illustrious General. When the Highlanders passed he seemed
much delighted with their appearance, saying, ‘They look very
well; have breeches, and are the better for that.’”<a name="FNanchor_618_619" id="FNanchor_618_619"></a><a href="#Footnote_618_619" class="fnanchor">[618]</a> Some years later
when Pitt “called for soldiers from the mountains of the North,”
“to allure them into the army it was thought proper to indulge
them in the continuance of their national dress.”<a name="FNanchor_619_620" id="FNanchor_619_620"></a><a href="#Footnote_619_620" class="fnanchor">[619]</a> Numerous were
the devices to evade the law, and great must have been the perplexities
of the magistrates. One of Wolfe’s officers wrote in 1752,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_172" id="Page_172">{172}</a></span>
that “one of his serjeants had taken a fellow wearing a blanket in
form of a philibeg. He carried him to Perth, but the Sheriff-substitute
did not commit him, because the blanket was not a tartan.
On his return he met another of the same kind; so, as he found it
needless to carry him before a magistrate, he took the blanket-philibeg
and cut it to pieces.” Another officer wrote two months
later: “One of my men brought me a man to all appearance in a
philibeg; but on close examination I found it to be a woman’s
petticoat, which answers every end of that part of the Highland
dress. I sent him to the Sheriff-substitute, who dismissed him.”<a name="FNanchor_620_621" id="FNanchor_620_621"></a><a href="#Footnote_620_621" class="fnanchor">[620]</a></p>

<p>Smollett, in his <cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>, pleads the cause of the
dejected Highlanders, who had not only been deprived of their
ancient garb, but, “what is a greater hardship still, are compelled
to wear breeches, a restraint which they cannot bear with any
degree of patience; indeed the majority wear them, not in the
proper place, but on poles or long staves over their shoulders.”<a name="FNanchor_621_622" id="FNanchor_621_622"></a><a href="#Footnote_621_622" class="fnanchor">[621]</a>
In 1782 the Marquis of Graham brought in a bill to repeal this
prohibitory Act. One of the English members asked that if it
became law, the dress should still be prohibited in England. When
six Highland soldiers had been quartered at a house in Hampshire,
“the singularity of their dress,” he said, “so much attracted the
eyes of the wife and daughters of the man of the house that he found
it expedient to take a lodging for them at another place.”<a name="FNanchor_622_623" id="FNanchor_622_623"></a><a href="#Footnote_622_623" class="fnanchor">[622]</a> A Lowland
friend tells me that one day at church her grandfather turned
two Highland officers out of his pew, as he thought their dress improper
where there were ladies. This she learnt from her aunt
who had been present. Old Malcolm Macleod, if he did not
return altogether to the ancient dress, nevertheless broke the law.
“He wore a pair of brogues; tartan hose which came up only near
to his knees, and left them bare; a purple camblet kilt; a black
waistcoat; a short green cloth coat bound with gold cord; a yellowish
bushy wig; a large blue bonnet with a gold thread button.”
Sir Walter Scott tells us that “to evade the law against the
tartan dress, the Highlanders used to dye their variegated plaids
and kilts into blue, green, or any single colour.”<a name="FNanchor_623_624" id="FNanchor_623_624"></a><a href="#Footnote_623_624" class="fnanchor">[623]</a> Malcolm had
done this with his kilt, but in his hose he asserted his independence.
Yet so early as the beginning of last century, according
to Martin, the Highland dress was fast dying out in Skye. “They<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_173" id="Page_173">{173}</a></span>
now,” he writes, “generally use coat, waistcoat, and breeches, as
elsewhere. Persons of distinction wear the garb in fashion in the
south of Scotland.”<a name="FNanchor_624_625" id="FNanchor_624_625"></a><a href="#Footnote_624_625" class="fnanchor">[624]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROW TO RAASAY.</div>

<p>While Johnson in the voyage to Raasay “sat high on the stern
of the boat like a magnificent Triton,” old Malcolm, no less magnificent
through his attire, took his turn at tugging the oar, “singing
an Erse song, the chorus of which was <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Hatyin foam foam eri</i>, with
words of his own.” The original was written in praise of Allan of
Muidart, a chief of the Clanranald family. The following is a translation
of the complete chorus:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Along, along, then haste along,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">For here no more I’ll stay;</div>
<div class="verse">I’ll braid and bind my tresses long,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">And o’er the hills away.”<a name="FNanchor_625_626" id="FNanchor_625_626"></a><a href="#Footnote_625_626" class="fnanchor">[625]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<p>In the sound between Scalpa and Raasay, “the wind,” writes
Boswell, “made the sea very rough. I did not like it. ‘This now,’
said Johnson, ‘is the Atlantic. If I should tell, at a tea-table in
London, that I have crossed the Atlantic in an open boat, how
they’d shudder, and what a fool they’d think me to expose myself
to such danger.’” In his letter to Mrs. Thrale he makes light of
the roughness of the waves. “The wind blew enough to give the
boat a kind of dancing agitation.” For a moment or two his temper
was ruffled, for by the carelessness of their man-servant his spurs
were carried overboard. “There was something wild,” he said,
“in letting a pair of spurs be carried into the sea out of a boat.”
What a fine opening we have here for the enthusiasm of the Johnson
Club! An expedition properly equipped should be sent to
dredge in this sound for the spurs, with directions to proceed afterwards
to the Isle of Mull, and make search for that famous piece
of timber, his walking-stick, which was lost there.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIGHLAND SINGING.</div>

<p>As the boat drew near the land the singing of the reapers on
shore was mingled with the song of the rowers. It was frequently
noticed by travellers how the Highlanders loved to keep time with
their songs to whatever they were doing. Gray heard the masons
singing in Erse all day long as they were building the park wall at
Glamis Castle.<a name="FNanchor_626_627" id="FNanchor_626_627"></a><a href="#Footnote_626_627" class="fnanchor">[626]</a> An earlier writer tells how “the women in harvest
work keep time by several barbarous tones of the voice; and stoop
and rise together as regularly as a rank of soldiers when they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_174" id="Page_174">{174}</a></span>
ground their arms. They proceed with great alacrity, it being
disgraceful for anyone to be out of time with the sickle.”<a name="FNanchor_627_628" id="FNanchor_627_628"></a><a href="#Footnote_627_628" class="fnanchor">[627]</a> According
to Pennant, “in the songs of the rowers the notes are commonly
long, the airs solemn and slow, rarely cheerful, it being impossible
for the oars to keep a quick time; the words generally have a religious
turn, consonant to that of the people.”<a name="FNanchor_628_629" id="FNanchor_628_629"></a><a href="#Footnote_628_629" class="fnanchor">[628]</a> Ramsay of Ochtertyre
says that “the women’s songs are in general very short and
plaintive. In travelling through the remote Highlands in harvest,
the sound of these little bands on every side has a most pleasing
effect on the mind of a stranger.” The custom, we learn from him,
was rapidly dying out at the end of last century.<a name="FNanchor_629_630" id="FNanchor_629_630"></a><a href="#Footnote_629_630" class="fnanchor">[629]</a> I did not myself
hear any of this singing in my wanderings; but a Scotch friend
tells me that more than forty years ago she remembers seeing a
field in which thirty Highland reapers were at work in couples, a
man and a woman together, all singing their Gaelic songs.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RAASAY.</div>

<p>Three or four hours’ stout rowing brought the boat to the shore
below the Laird of Raasay’s house. “The approach to it,” says
Boswell, “was very pleasing. We saw before us a beautiful bay, well
defended by a rocky coast; a good family mansion; a fine verdure
about it, with a considerable number of trees; and beyond it hills and
mountains in gradation of wildness.” At the entrance to the bay is a
rocky islet, where we landed, when we visited Raasay on the afternoon
of a bright June day. As it was unoccupied, we took formal
possession, with a better claim than the European nations have to the
well-peopled islands of the Southern Seas. Its name, we learnt
from our boatman, was Goat Island, and just as Johnson was
addressed as Island Isa, so we were willing to derive our title from
our new acquisition. We passed a full half an hour in our domain
with great satisfaction. Who, we asked, “would change the rocks
of Scotland for the Strand?” The waves beat on our coast, breaking
in white crests far away in the open sound. We looked across
the little bay on the sunny shore of our nearest neighbour, the
Laird of Raasay, and did not envy him the pleasant grassy slope,
almost ready for the scythe, which stretched from his mansion to the
edge of the sea, or the fine woods which covered the hills at the
back of his house. We thought how much the scene is changed
since our travellers saw it. Then there was no landing-place;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_175" id="Page_175">{175}</a></span>
steps had not been even cut in the natural rock. “The crags,”
Johnson complained, “were irregularly broken, and a false step
would have been very mischievous.” Yet “a few men with pickaxes
might have cut an ascent of stairs out of any part of the rock
in a week’s time.” There is now a small stone pier. The hayfield,
in the memory of people still living, was all heathland down to the
water’s edge, with a rough cart-track running across it. Trees have
been everywhere planted, and the hill-sides are beautifully wooded.
Even before Johnson’s time something had been done in the way
of improvement. Martin, in his <cite>Description of the Western Isles</cite>,<a name="FNanchor_630_631" id="FNanchor_630_631"></a><a href="#Footnote_630_631" class="fnanchor">[630]</a>
mentions “an orchard with several sorts of berries, pot-herbs, &amp;c.”
In the copy of Martin’s work in the Bodleian Library, Toland has
entered in the margin: “Wonderful in Scotland anywhere.” Boswell
mentions “a good garden, plentifully stocked with vegetables,
and strawberries, raspberries, currants, &amp;c.” The house&mdash;that
“neat modern fabric,” which Johnson praises as “the seat of plenty,
civility, and cheerfulness”&mdash;still remains, but it is almost hidden
beneath the great additions which have in later years been made.
In a letter to Mrs. Thrale, he says: “It is not large, though we<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_176" id="Page_176">{176}</a></span>
were told in our passage that it had eleven fine rooms, nor magnificently
furnished, but our utensils<a name="FNanchor_631_632" id="FNanchor_631_632"></a><a href="#Footnote_631_632" class="fnanchor">[631]</a> were most commonly silver.
We went up into a dining-room about as large as your blue room,
where we had something given us to eat, and tea and coffee.” The
blue room, less fortunate than its rival at Raasay, has been swept
away, with all the beauty and the associations of Streatham Park.
I was shown his chamber, with his portrait hanging on the wall. A
walking-stick which he had used is treasured up. From his
windows he looked down into the garden. However productive it
may have been, it was not, I fear, so gay with flowers as it was
when I saw it, or so rich in shrubs. I walked between fuchsia
hedges that were much higher than my head. One fuchsia bush,
or rather tree, which stood apart, covered with its branches a round
of sixty feet. Its trunk was as thick as a man’s thigh. The
Western Islands are kept free from severe frosts by the waters of
the Gulf Stream, so that in the spots which face the southern suns,
and are sheltered from the north and east, there is a growth which
rivals, and perhaps outdoes, that of Devonshire and Cornwall.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>RAASAY.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Not far from the house is the ruined chapel which provoked
Johnson’s sarcasm. “It has been,” he writes, “for many years
popular to talk of the lazy devotion of the Romish clergy; over the
sleepy laziness of men that erected churches we may indulge our
superiority with a new triumph, by comparing it with the fervid
activity of those who suffer them to fall.” Boswell took a more
cheerful view. “There was something comfortable,” he wrote, “in
the thought of being so near a piece of consecrated ground.” <span class="sidenote">THE MACLEODS OF RAASAY.</span> Here
they looked upon the tombs of the Macleods of Raasay, that
ancient family which boasted that “during four hundred years they
had not gained or lost a single acre;” which was worthily represented
in their host; which lasted for two generations longer, and
then sank in ruins amidst the wild follies of a single laird. Whilst
rack-renting landlords were driving their people across the wide
Atlantic, Macleod of Raasay could boast “that his island had not
yet been forsaken by a single inhabitant.” Pleased with all he saw,
“Johnson was in fine spirits. ‘This,’ he said, ‘is truly the
patriarchal life; this is what we came to find.’” He was delighted
with the free and friendly life, the feasting and the dancing, and all<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_177" id="Page_177">{177}</a></span>
“the pleasures of this little Court.” The evening of their arrival,
as soon as dinner was finished, “the carpet was taken up, the fiddler
of the family came, and a very vigorous and general dance was
begun.” According to Boswell, “Johnson was so delighted with
this scene, that he said, ‘I know not how we shall get away.’ It
entertained me to observe him sitting by, while we danced, sometimes
in deep meditation, sometimes smiling complacently, sometimes
looking upon Hooke’s <cite>Roman History</cite>, and sometimes talking
a little, amidst the noise of the ball, to Mr. Donald M’Queen, who
anxiously gathered knowledge from him.” The same accommodating
hospitality was shown here as at Corrichatachin in finding
sleeping room for the large party that was assembled. “I had a
chamber to myself,” writes Johnson, “which in eleven rooms to
forty people was more than my share. How the company and the
family were distributed is not easy to tell. Macleod, the chieftain
of Dunvegan, and Boswell and I had all single chambers on the
first floor. There remained eight rooms only for at least seven-and-thirty
lodgers. I suppose they put up temporary beds in the
dining-room, where they stowed all the young ladies. There was
a room above stairs with six beds, in which they put ten men.” <span class="sidenote">THE PATRIARCHAL LIFE.</span> The patriarchal life was so complete that in this island, with a population
estimated at nine hundred,<a name="FNanchor_632_633" id="FNanchor_632_633"></a><a href="#Footnote_632_633" class="fnanchor">[632]</a> there was neither justice of the
peace nor constable. Even in Skye there was but one magistrate,
and, so late as forty years ago, but one policeman. Raasay is still
without a justice. The people, I was told, settle all their disputes
among themselves, and keep clear of crime. Much of the land is
still held on the old tribal system. “I have ascertained,” writes Sir
Henry Maine, “that the families which formed the village communities
only just extinct in the Western Highlands had the lands
of the village re-distributed among them by lot at fixed intervals of
time.”<a name="FNanchor_633_634" id="FNanchor_633_634"></a><a href="#Footnote_633_634" class="fnanchor">[633]</a> In Raasay there are little plots of land which every year
are still distributed by lot. So small are they, and so close together
that it often happens that five or six families are all at the same
time getting in their harvest on a strip not much larger than a
couple of lawn tennis grounds.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SCOTTISH DANCES.</div>

<p>Boswell with three Highland gentlemen spent one day in
exploring the island, and in climbing to the top of Dun Can, or<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_178" id="Page_178">{178}</a></span>
Raasay’s Cap, as sailors called the mountain, to whom far away at
sea it was a conspicuous landmark. On the top they danced a
Highland reel. If we may trust the statement of a young English
tourist, the dance was just as enjoyable, though there were no
ladies for partners. “The Scotch,” he writes, “admire the reel for
its own merit alone. A Scotchman comes into an assembly room
as he would into a field of exercise, dances till he is literally tired,
possibly without ever looking at his partner. In most countries the
men have a partiality for dancing with a woman: but here I have
frequently seen four gentlemen perform one of these reels seemingly
with the same pleasure as if they had had the most sprightly
girl for a partner. They give you the idea that they could with
equal glee cast off round a joint-stool or set to a corner cupboard.”<a name="FNanchor_634_635" id="FNanchor_634_635"></a><a href="#Footnote_634_635" class="fnanchor">[634]</a>
Beyond Dun Can to the north-west the travellers visited the
ruins of the old castle, once the residence of the lairds of Raasay.
On their return from their walk of four-and-twenty miles over very
rugged ground, “we piqued ourselves,” Boswell writes, “at not
being outdone at the nightly ball by our less active friends, who
had remained at home.”</p>

<div class="figcenter w500">

<div class="caption"><p>DUN CAN.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Of the ancient crosses which he mentions I fear but one is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_179" id="Page_179">{179}</a></span>
remaining. Martin, who looked upon them as pyramids to the
deceased ladies of the family, found eight. Malcolm Macleod
thought that they were “false sentinels&mdash;a common deception to
make invaders imagine an island better guarded.” The learned
M’Queen maintained that they “marked the boundaries of the
sacred territory within which an asylum was to be had.” In this
opinion Boswell concurred.</p>

<p>Delightful as the mansion at Raasay seemed to the travellers,
with “the rough ocean and the rocky land, the beating billows and
the howling storm without, while within was plenty and elegance,
beauty and gaiety, the song and the dance,” yet it had seen another
sight only seven-and-twenty years earlier. In the island the Young
Pretender “in his distress was hidden for two nights, and the
king’s troops burnt the whole country, and killed some of the
cattle. You may guess,” continues Johnson, “at the opinions that
prevail in this country; they are, however, content with fighting for
their king; they do not drink for him. We had no foolish healths.” <span class="sidenote">AN EARTHLY PARADISE.</span> Pleased as our travellers were with their four days’ residence here,
in the midst of storms and rain, how much would their pleasure
have been increased could they have seen it as I saw it in the bright
summer weather! No one who visited it then would have said
with Johnson that “it has little that can detain a traveller, except
the laird and his family.” It has almost everything that Nature
can give in the delightfulness of scenery and situation.<a name="FNanchor_635_636" id="FNanchor_635_636"></a><a href="#Footnote_635_636" class="fnanchor">[635]</a> Like
Boswell, as I gazed upon it, I might “for a moment have doubted
whether unhappiness had any place in Raasay;” but, like him, I
might “soon have had the delusion dispelled,” by recalling Johnson’s
lines:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Yet hope not life from grief or danger free,</div>
<div class="verse">Nor think the doom of man reversed for thee.”</div>

<p>Much as Johnson had delighted in the patriarchal life at
Raasay, yet after four days’ stay he became impatient to move.
“There was,” writes Boswell, “so numerous a company, mostly
young people, there was such a flow of familiar talk, so much noise,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">{180}</a></span>
and so much singing and dancing, that little opportunity was left
for his energetic conversation. He seemed sensible of this; for
when I told him how happy they were at having him there, he said,
‘Yet we have not been able to entertain them much.’” The
weather, which had been very wet and stormy, cleared up on the
morning of September 12. “Though it was Sunday,” says Johnson,
“we thought it proper to snatch the opportunity of a calm
day.” <span class="sidenote">THE ROW TO PORTREE.</span> A row of some five or six miles brought them to Portree in
Skye, a harbour whose name commemorated the visit of King
James V. The busy little town on the top of the cliff, with its
Court House, hotels, banks, and shops, which has grown up at the
end of the land-locked harbour, did not then exist. Sir James
Macdonald, “the Marcellus of Scotland,” as Boswell called him,
had intended to build a village there, but by his untimely death the
design had come to nothing. There seems to have been little
more than the public-house at which the travellers dined. “It was,”
Johnson believed, “the only one of the island.” He forgot, however,
as Boswell pointed out to him when he read his narrative,
another at Sconser, and a third at Dunvegan. “These,” Boswell
adds, “are the only inns properly so called. There are many huts
where whisky is sold.”<a name="FNanchor_636_637" id="FNanchor_636_637"></a><a href="#Footnote_636_637" class="fnanchor">[636]</a> <span class="sidenote">HIGHLAND VOLUNTEERS.</span> On the evening which I spent at Portree,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_181" id="Page_181">{181}</a></span>
a company of Highland volunteers were going through their yearly
inspection, in tartan plaids and kilts, with the bagpipes playing as
only bagpipes can. Had it been as it was in the days of their
forefathers, when twelve Highlanders and a bagpipe made a
rebellion, there was ample provision made here for at least five or
six. Each volunteer, in addition to his guilt as a rebel, both for
the arms which he carried, and the garb which he wore, would have
been liable to be sent off by summary process to serve as a common
soldier. But happily we live in loyal days, and under milder laws.
These bold citizen-soldiers ran but one risk, which no doubt was
averted by a good-natured and sympathetic magistracy. To a fine
of five shillings for being drunk and disorderly some of them certainly
became exposed as the evening wore away. Let us hope
that their excess was little more than an excess of loyalty in drinking
the health of a Hanoverian queen.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>KINGSBURGH.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">FLORA MACDONALD.</div>

<p>At Portree our travellers took horse for Kingsburgh, a farmhouse
on Loch Snizort, whither they went, though a little off their
road, in order to see Flora Macdonald. She had married a gentleman
of the same clan, and so had not changed her name. “Here,”
writes Johnson, “I had the honour of saluting the far-famed Miss<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">{182}</a></span>
Flora Macdonald, who conducted the Prince, dressed as her maid,
through the English forces, from the island of Lewis; and when
she came to Skye, dined with the English officers, and left her
maid below. She must then have been a very young lady&mdash;she is
now not old&mdash;of a pleasing person and elegant behaviour. She
told me that she thought herself honoured by my visit; and I am
sure that whatever regard she bestowed on me was liberally
repaid.” Boswell describes her as “a little woman of a genteel
appearance, and uncommonly mild and well-bred. To see Dr.
Samuel Johnson, the great champion of the English Tories, salute
Miss Flora Macdonald in the Isle of Skye was a striking sight.”
By <em>salute</em> I have little doubt that both Boswell and Johnson meant
<em>kiss</em>. Johnson in his <cite>Dictionary</cite> gives it as the third meaning of
the word, though he cites no authority for the usage. “The
Scotch,” wrote Topham in 1774, “have still the custom of salutation
on introduction to strangers. It very seldom happens that the
salute is a voluntary one, and it frequently is the cause of disgust
and embarrassment to the fair sex.”<a name="FNanchor_637_638" id="FNanchor_637_638"></a><a href="#Footnote_637_638" class="fnanchor">[637]</a> By the uncouth appearance
of the man who thus saluted her, Flora Macdonald might with
good reason have been astonished, for “the news had reached her
that Mr. Boswell was coming to Skye, and one Mr. Johnson, a
young English buck, with him.” Her husband, “a large stately
man, with a steady, sensible countenance,” who was going to try
his fortune in America, was perhaps for that reason the more careless
of obeying the laws of the country he was leaving. This
evening he wore the Highland costume. “He had his tartan plaid
thrown about him, a large blue bonnet with a knot of black riband
like a cockade, a brown short coat of a kind of duffil, a tartan waistcoat
with gold buttons and gold button-holes, a bluish philibeg, and
tartan hose.” The bed-curtains of the room in which our travellers
slept were also of tartan. Johnson’s bed had whatever fame could
attach to it through its having been occupied for one night “by the
grandson of the unfortunate King James the Second,” to borrow
Boswell’s description of him. The grandson, before many years
passed over his head, proved not unworthy of the grandfather&mdash;equally
mean and equally selfish. The happy failure of the rebels
hindered him from displaying his vices, with a kingdom for his
stage. His worthlessness, which though it might have been suspected
from his stock, could not have been known in his youth,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">{183}</a></span>
takes away nothing, however, from the just fame of Flora Macdonald,
“whose name will be mentioned in history, and, if courage
and fidelity be virtues, mentioned with honour.” Johnson, after
recounting how “the sheets which the Prince used were never put
to any meaner offices, but were wrapped up by the lady of the
house, and at last, according to her desire, were laid round her in
her grave,” ends the passage with much satisfaction, by observing:
“These are not Whigs.” Upon the table in the room he left a
piece of paper “on which he had written with his pencil these
words: <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Quantum cedat virtutibus aurum</i>.”<a name="FNanchor_638_639" id="FNanchor_638_639"></a><a href="#Footnote_638_639" class="fnanchor">[638]</a> He was thinking, no
doubt, of the reward of £30,000 set upon Charles Edward’s head,
and of the fidelity of the poor Highlanders who one and all refused
to betray him. To more than fifty people he was forced in his
wanderings to trust his life, many of them “in the lowest paths of
fortune,” and not one of them proved faithless. It was well for
him that he had not had to trust to fifty hangers-on of a Court.</p>

<p>The old house in which he had taken shelter for one night, and
where Boswell and Johnson were so hospitably received, where
they heard from their hostess the strange story of her adventures&mdash;this
interesting old house no longer exists. Some of the trees
which surround the modern residence must be old enough to have
seen not only our two travellers, but also the fugitive Prince. As
we looked upon it from the opposite shore of the narrow loch it
seemed a pleasant spot, nearly facing the west, sheltered from the
east by hills, and embosomed in trees, with meadows in front
sloping down to the sea. In the rear rose barren dreary hills, but
all their lower slopes were green with grass and with the young
crops of oats. Far down the loch the green slopes ended in a
steep rocky coast. In the distance the mountains of Lewis fringed
the northern sky. The steep headland on which we sat was
beautiful with grasses and flowers and ferns and heather. Of wild
flowers we gathered no less than thirty-six varieties on this one
small spot. We found even a lingering primrose, though June was
rapidly drawing to its close. How different were our thoughts as
we watched this peaceful scene from those which, one hundred and
forty-three years earlier, had troubled the watchers as the young
Wanderer slept! As the morning wore on, and he did not awake,
one of them, in her alarm lest the soldiers should surprise him,
roused her father, who was also in hiding, and begged that “they<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_184" id="Page_184">{184}</a></span>
should not remain here too long. He said, ‘Let the poor man
repose himself after his fatigues! and as for me, I care not, though
they take off this old grey head ten or eleven years sooner than I
should die in the course of nature.’ He then wrapped himself in
the bed-clothes, and again fell fast asleep.” That same afternoon the
two fugitives set off for Portree, where the Prince took boat for
Raasay.</p>

Lochs Snizort and Grishinish. But they sent their horses by land

still some miles of dreary riding through the most melancholy of
moorlands. There were no roads or even paths. “A guide,”
writes Boswell, “explored the way, much in the same manner as, I
suppose, is pursued in the wilds of America, by observing certain
marks known only to the inhabitants.” In some places the ground<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_185" id="Page_185">{185}</a></span>
was so boggy that it would not bear the weight of horse and rider,
and they were forced to dismount and walk. <span class="sidenote">DUNVEGAN CASTLE.</span> It was late in the afternoon when they reached Dunvegan Castle&mdash;that hospitable
home where Johnson “tasted lotus, and was in danger,” as he said,
“of forgetting that he was ever to depart.” This ancient seat of
the Macleods was less beautiful, but far more interesting as he saw
it than it is at the present day. The barrenness of nature has been
covered with a luxuriant growth, and the land all around “which
presented nothing but wild, moorish, hilly, and craggy appearances,”
is now finely wooded. But while the setting is so greatly
improved, the ancient building which is enshrined has suffered
beneath the hand of a restorer. It is true that some great improvements
have been made. The wing which had so long been left
unfinished, through a superstitious fear that the owner would not
long outlive the completion&mdash;“this skeleton of a castle,” as Johnson
describes it&mdash;has been completed. A fine approach has been
formed from the side of the land. But in the alterations which
were made about fifty years ago an architect was employed who
must surely have acquired his mischievous art in erecting sham
fortresses on the banks of the Clyde for the wealthy traders of
Glasgow. It is greatly to be wished that a judicious earthquake
would bring to the ground his pepper-box turrets. Nevertheless,
in spite of all that he has done&mdash;and he did his worst,&mdash;it still
remains a noble pile, nobly placed. It is built on the rocky shore
of a small bay, and well sheltered from the violence of the waves by
an island which lies across the mouth, and by headlands on both
sides. Through narrow inlets are seen the open waters of Loch
Follart, and beyond them the everlasting hills. We saw it on a
fine summer evening, when the long seaweeds were swaying in the
gentle heaving of the tiny waves. Outside the bay two yachts
were furling their sails, for the morrow was the day of rest. The
sea-birds were hovering and screaming all around. A great heron
was standing on a rock, with his white breast reflected in the water.
A little to the north a long mast was lying on the beach, washed up
from a wreck which, black with seaweed, is discovered at low tide.
The old castle, the finely wooded hills, the rocks covered with
fern and heath, the clear reflections in the sea of the mountains
across the loch, the island, the inlets, the white sails of the yachts,
the tranquil beauty of the summer evening&mdash;all moved us deeply.
One thing only was wanting. <span class="sidenote">RORIE MORE’S NURSE.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_186" id="Page_186">{186}</a></span> The delightful weather which the
country had so long enjoyed had silenced “Rorie More’s Nurse.”
There was not water enough in it to have caught that good knight’s
ear; still less to have lulled him to sleep. Johnson had seen it “in
full perfection.” It was “a noble cascade,” he said. But he paid
dearly for the fineness of the sight; for during the whole of his stay
the weather was dreary, with high winds and violent rain. “We
filled up the time as we could,” he writes; “sometimes by talk,
sometimes by reading. I have never wanted books in the Isle of
Skye.” So comfortably was he situated that he could hardly be
persuaded to move on. “Here we settled,” he writes, “and did
not spoil the present hour with thoughts of departure.” When on
Saturday Boswell proposed that they should leave on the following
Monday, when their week would be completed, he replied: “No,
Sir, I will not go before Wednesday. I will have some more of
this good.”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAIRD OF MACLEOD.</div>

<p>He was fortunate in his hosts. The Laird, a young man of
nineteen, quickly won his friendship. He had been the pupil at
University College, Oxford, of George Strahan, who had been<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_187" id="Page_187">{187}</a></span>
known to Johnson from his childhood. Boswell describes Macleod
as “a most promising youth, who with a noble spirit struggles with
difficulties, and endeavours to preserve his people. He has been
left with an incumbrance of forty thousand pounds debt, and
annuities to the amount of thirteen hundred pounds a year. Dr.
Johnson said, ‘If he gets the better of all this, he’ll be a hero; and
I hope he will. I have not met with a young man who had more
desire to learn, or who has learnt more. I have seen nobody that
I wish more to do a kindness to than Macleod.’” According to
Knox, who was an impartial witness, he was an excellent landlord.
Distressed though he was by this heavy burthen of debt, “he
raised no rents, turned out no tenants, used no man with severity,
and in all respects, and under the most pressing exigences, maintained
the character of a liberal and humane friend of mankind.”<a name="FNanchor_639_640" id="FNanchor_639_640"></a><a href="#Footnote_639_640" class="fnanchor">[639]</a>
He formed at one time the design of writing his own Life.
Unhappily he left but a fragment. His father had died early, so
that on the death of his grandfather, the year before Johnson’s
visit, he had succeeded to the property&mdash;the estates in Skye, the
nine inhabited isles and the islands uninhabited almost beyond
number. “He did not know to within twenty square miles the
extent of his territories in Skye.” But vast as these domains
were, the revenue which they produced was but small. One estate
of eighty thousand acres was only rented at six hundred pounds
a year.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“His grandfather,” he writes, “had entered upon his inheritance in the most
prosperous condition; but the course of his life was expensive, his temper convivial
and hospitable, and he continued to impair his fortune till his death. He was the
first of our family who was led to leave the patriarchal government of the clan, and
to mix in the pursuits and ambition of the world. He had always been a most
beneficent chieftain, but in the beginning of 1772, his necessities having lately induced
him to raise his rents, he became much alarmed by the new spirit which had
reached his clan. Aged and infirm he was unable to apply the remedy in person;
he devolved the task on me, and gave me for an assistant our nearest male relation,
Colonel Macleod, of Talisker. The estate was loaded with debt, encumbered with
a numerous issue from himself and my father, and charged with some jointures.
His tenants had lost in that severe winter above a third of their cattle.<a name="FNanchor_640_641" id="FNanchor_640_641"></a><a href="#Footnote_640_641" class="fnanchor">[640]</a> My friend
and I were empowered to grant such deductions in the rents as might seem reasonable;
but we found it terrible to decide between the justice to creditors, the necessities
of an ancient family, and the distresses of an impoverished tenantry. I called<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_188" id="Page_188">{188}</a></span>
the people together; I laid before them the situation of our family; I acknowledged
the hardships under which they laboured; I reminded them of the manner in
which their ancestors had lived with mine; I combated their passion for America;
I promised to live among them; I desired every district to point out some of their
most respected men to settle with me every claim, and I promised to do everything
for their relief which in reason I could. Our labour was not in vain. We gave considerable
abatements in the rents; few emigrated; and the clan conceived the most
lively attachment to me, which they most effectually manifested.</p>

<p>“I remained at home till the end of 1774, but I consider this as the most gloomy
period of my life. Educated in a liberal manner, fired with ambition, fond of
society, I found myself in confinement in a remote corner of the world; without
any hope of extinguishing the debts of my family, or of ever emerging from poverty
and obscurity. I had also the torment of seeing my mother and sisters immured
with me.</p>

<p>“In 1774 [1773] Dr. Samuel Johnson, with his companion, Mr. Boswell, visited
our dreary regions; it was my good fortune to be enabled to practise the virtue of
hospitality on this occasion. The learned traveller spent a fortnight at Dunvegan;
and indeed amply repaid our cares to please him by the most instructive and
entertaining conversation. I procured for him the company of the most learned
clergymen and sagacious inhabitants of the islands.”<a name="FNanchor_641_642" id="FNanchor_641_642"></a><a href="#Footnote_641_642" class="fnanchor">[641]</a></p></div>

<p>Macleod’s high praise of Johnson is in curious contradiction to
Sir Walter Scott’s account, that “when winter-bound at Dunvegan,
Johnson’s temper became most execrable, and beyond all endurance
save that of his guide (Boswell).”<a name="FNanchor_642_643" id="FNanchor_642_643"></a><a href="#Footnote_642_643" class="fnanchor">[642]</a> Mr. Croker, on receiving this
account from Sir Walter, applied to the Laird’s son and successor,
“who assured him emphatically they were all <em>delighted</em> with him.”<a name="FNanchor_643_644" id="FNanchor_643_644"></a><a href="#Footnote_643_644" class="fnanchor">[643]</a>
Nevertheless, as I have already stated,<a name="FNanchor_644_645" id="FNanchor_644_645"></a><a href="#Footnote_644_645" class="fnanchor">[644]</a> the young ladies of the
family do not seem to have shared in this delight. The true
Johnsonian must look upon them as “a set of wretched un-idea’d
girls,” and so forgive their want of taste.</p>

<p>Macleod, two or three years after our traveller’s visit, raised a
company of his own Highlanders, and entered the army. In the
war against our colonists in America he and his wife, who had
accompanied him, were taken prisoners. In their captivity they
made the acquaintance and won the friendship of George Washington.
Let us hope that the heart of the founder of the great
American Commonwealth was softened towards the author of
<cite>Taxation no Tyranny</cite> by the anecdotes which he heard of him
from his warm friend, the young Scottish chief. On his return
home he raised the second battalion of the forty-second Highlanders,
and served with distinction in India as their colonel. Zoffany
painted him in his soldier’s dress, surrounded with elephants,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_189" id="Page_189">{189}</a></span>
camels, and Hindoos, with Highland scenery in the background.
Just before he started for the East he dined at the house of one of
his <em>tacksmen</em>, or chief tenants, “who said that all the dishes should
be the produce of Macleod’s estate and the shores thereof.
Amongst a profusion of other dishes there were thirteen different
kinds of fish.”<a name="FNanchor_645_646" id="FNanchor_645_646"></a><a href="#Footnote_645_646" class="fnanchor">[645]</a> He died in 1802 at the early age of forty-six.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LADY MACLEOD.</div>

<p>Fortunate as Johnson was in having this amiable and high-spirited
youth for his host, scarcely less fortunate was he in his
hostess, the Laird’s mother, Lady Macleod. The title which she
bore was one of courtesy. Up to this time the wives of Highland
lairds, and also of Scotch judges, seem commonly to have been
addressed as <em>Lady</em>. Johnson’s hostess at Lochbuie, the wife of the
laird, is called Lady Lochbuie by Boswell. The change to the
modern usage had, however, begun; for Ramsay of Ochtertyre,
speaking of the year 1769, says that, “Somebody asked Lord Auchinleck
before his second marriage if the lady was to be called Mrs.
Boswell, according to the modern fashion.”<a name="FNanchor_646_647" id="FNanchor_646_647"></a><a href="#Footnote_646_647" class="fnanchor">[646]</a> Johnson was not wholly
a stranger to his hostess. “I had once,” he writes, “attracted her
notice in London.” She was able to render his stay pleasant, for
from her long residence in England, “she knew all the arts of
southern elegance, and all the modes of English economy.” In his
talk she took great delight, though when one day she heard him
maintain ““that no man was naturally good more than a wolf, and no
woman either,” she said in a low voice, ‘This is worse than
Swift.’” Knox, who visited Dunvegan in 1786 records the
following anecdote:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Lady Macleod, who had repeatedly helped Dr. Johnson to sixteen dishes or
upwards of tea, asked him if a small basin would not save him trouble, and be more
agreeable. ‘I wonder, Madam,’ answered he roughly, ‘why all the ladies ask me
such impertinent questions. It is to save yourselves trouble, Madam, and not me.’
The lady was silent and went on with her task.”<a name="FNanchor_647_648" id="FNanchor_647_648"></a><a href="#Footnote_647_648" class="fnanchor">[647]</a></p></div>

<p>It is not likely that Knox had the story at first hand, for when
he visited Dunvegan, the Castle was occupied by a Major
Alexander Macleod, who had married a daughter of Flora Macdonald.
It is probable, therefore, that Lady Macleod was not
living there at the time. The number of cups of tea may have
grown as the story passed from one to another. We shall find in
the next chapter that at Ulinish Johnson was reported to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_190" id="Page_190">{190}</a></span>
exceeded even this feat in tea-drinking. Lady Eldon used to
relate that one evening at Oxford she had helped him to fifteen.
Cumberland, who was not famed for accuracy, did not go beyond
a dozen as the number supplied to the great man by Mrs. Cumberland.
Short even of this Johnson might very well “have turned
his cup,” as he had done at Aberbrothick, and muttered, “<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">claudite
jam rivos, pueri</i>.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD ROCK.</div>

<p>Lady Macleod was discontented with the barrenness of Dunvegan,
and longed to move the seat of the family to a spot about
five miles off, “where she could make gardens and other ornaments.
She insisted that the rock was very inconvenient; that
there was no place near it where a good garden could be made;
that it must always be a rude place; that it was a <em>Herculean</em>
labour to make a dinner here.” “I was vexed,” writes Boswell,
“to find the alloy of modern refinement in a lady who had so much
old family spirit. ‘Have all the comforts and conveniences of life
upon it,’ I said, ‘but never leave Rorie More’s cascade.’ ‘It is
very well for you,’ she replied, ‘who have a fine place, and everything
easy, to talk thus, and think of chaining honest folks to a
rock. You would not live upon it yourself.’ ‘Yes, Madam,’ said
I, ‘I would live upon it, were I Laird of Macleod, and should be
unhappy if I were not upon it.’ <span class="smcap">Johnson</span> (with a strong voice and
most determined manner). ‘Madam, rather than quit the old rock,
Boswell would live in the pit; he would make his bed in the
dungeon.’ The lady was puzzled a little. She still returned to
her pretty farm&mdash;rich ground&mdash;fine garden. ‘Madam,’ said Dr.
Johnson, ‘were they in Asia, I would not leave the rock.’”</p>

<p>Her visitors were in the right. The scene was too noble a
one to be lightly deserted. There was no need to go five miles
for trees and gardens. <span class="sidenote">DR. JOHNSON’S PLANTATIONS.</span> The
Scotch for their carelessness in adorning their homes did not here
fall on deaf ears. His host and his host’s son planted largely, and
the fruit of his advice and of their judicious labours is seen in the
beautiful woods and shrubberies which surround the Castle.
Rorie More’s Cascade is almost hidden by trees. A Dutch garden
has been formed, where, under the shelter of the thick beech hedge
which encloses it, the roses bloom. Close to the ruins of an ancient
chapel, with glimpses through the trees of the waters of the Loch,
a conservatory has been built. Had Johnson seen the beautiful and
rare flowers which grow in it, he would surely never have maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_191" id="Page_191">{191}</a></span>
that “a green-house is a childish thing.” What a change
has come since the day when he wrote that “the country about
Dunvegan is rough and barren. There are no trees except in the
orchard, which is a low, sheltered spot, surrounded with a wall.”
The rough old fellow passed over the land with his strong common
sense and his vigorous reproofs, and the rudeness of nature has
been tamed, and its barrenness changed into luxuriance. He deserved
better of mankind even than he “who made two ears of
corn, or two blades of grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where
only one grew before;”<a name="FNanchor_648_649" id="FNanchor_648_649"></a><a href="#Footnote_648_649" class="fnanchor">[648]</a> for he made trees and flowers to grow
where before there had been none. He did that which a king of
Scotland had tried to do and failed. James the Fifth’s command
that round every house plantations should be made had resulted, I
was told, in the few trees which Johnson saw. But where the
king’s could be almost counted on the fingers of the two hands,
Johnson’s cover whole hill-sides. I was informed by Miss Macleod,
of Macleod, for whose kindness I am most grateful, that she had
no doubt that it was his reproaches which stirred up her grandfather
to plant so widely. How luxuriantly nature can deck the
ground when she is aided by art, was seen in the strange variety of
flowers which we noticed in the grounds. Two seasons seemed to
be mingled into one, for we found at the same time wild roses, the
hawthorn, blue bells, cuckoo flowers, heather, lupins, laburnums,
and rhododendrons.</p>

<p>In ancient days the only access to the castle, says Sir Walter
Scott, was “from the sea by a subterranean staircase, partly arched,
partly cut in the rock, which winding up through the cliff opened
into the court.”<a name="FNanchor_649_650" id="FNanchor_649_650"></a><a href="#Footnote_649_650" class="fnanchor">[649]</a> These steps Johnson oddly describes as “a pair
of stairs,” just as if they were in an Oxford college or the Temple.
When the tide was up access was cut off, so that a visitor who had
arrived by land must at the very end of his journey have taken boat
in order to gain the entrance. A little above the lower gate, on
the side of the passage, there was an old well, with uncovered
mouth. At the christening of the present laird, one of the guests
who had drunk too freely, going down the steps to his boat, fell in
and was drowned. The well was at once enclosed, and has never
been used since. Even in Johnson’s time its water, though not
brackish in spite of its being so near to the sea, was not much used.
The stream which formed Rorie More’s Cascade was thought to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_192" id="Page_192">{192}</a></span>
afford a purer supply. It was not by this staircase that our
travellers entered the castle, but by a long flight of steps which the
last laird had made on the side of the land. They were not guarded
by hand-rails. Many years ago a milkmaid coming up them with her
pails on a stormy day, was carried over by a high wind, and much
hurt. They have given place to the present approach by a carriage-road
carried over the chasm which cut off the castle from the neighbouring
land.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE STATELY DINING-ROOM.</div>

<p>On the walls of the “stately dining-room” where our travellers
were first received,
I saw hanging
some fine portraits
by Raeburn, their
host and his wife
and their eldest
son, a lad with a
sweet honest face,
who was lost with
his ship, the Royal
Charlotte, in the
Bay of Naples. Near them hang
“the wicked laird” and his two
wives. There is a tradition that his
first wife had fled from him on account
of his cruelty, but had been
enticed back by a friendly letter.
When her husband had caught her,
he starved her to death in the dungeon.
It was no doubt the sight
of these pictures which one day at
table led the company to talk of
portraits; when Johnson maintained that “their chief excellence is
being like. One would like,” he added, “to see how Rorie More
looked. Truth, Sir, is of the greatest value in these things.”</p>

<p>In the same room stands a handsome old sideboard, bearing
the date of 1603. Though it goes back to the year of the union of
the two Crowns, yet of all the festive gatherings which it has
witnessed, perhaps there is none that was more striking than that
evening when the Highland gentlemen listened to Johnson’s “full
strain of eloquence. We were,” writes Boswell, “a jovial company<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_193" id="Page_193">{193}</a></span>
at supper. The laird, surrounded by so many of his clan, was to
me a pleasing sight. They listened with wonder and pleasure
while Dr. Johnson harangued.” <span class="sidenote">SIR WALTER SCOTT AT DUNVEGAN.</span> It was very likely in this same
room that Sir Walter Scott breakfasted that August morning forty-one
years later, “when he woke under the castle of Dunvegan. I
had,” he writes, “sent a card to the laird of Macleod, who came off
before we were dressed, and carried us to his castle to breakfast.”<a name="FNanchor_650_651" id="FNanchor_650_651"></a><a href="#Footnote_650_651" class="fnanchor">[650]</a></p>

<div class="caption"><p>DINING ROOM, DUNVEGAN CASTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The noble drawing-room, with the deep recesses for the windows
in walls nine feet thick, is not the one described by Boswell.
The drawing-room which he saw “had formerly been,” he says, “the
bed-chamber of Sir Roderick Macleod, and he chose it because
behind it there was a cascade, the sound of which disposed him to
sleep.” At the time of Sir Walter Scott’s visit it had again become a
bed-room, for here he slept on a stormy night. <span class="sidenote">THE HAUNTED ROOM.</span> He had accepted,
he says, “the courteous offer of the haunted apartment,” and this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_194" id="Page_194">{194}</a></span>
was the room which was given him. “An autumnal blast, sometimes
clear, sometimes driving mist before it, swept along the
troubled billows of the lake, which it occasionally concealed and by
fits disclosed. The waves rushed in wild disorder on the shore,
and covered with foam the steep pile of rocks, which rising from
the sea in forms something resembling the human figure have
obtained the name of Macleod’s Maidens. The voice of an angry
cascade, termed the nurse of Rorie More, was heard from time to
time mingling its notes with those of wind and wave. Such was
the haunted room at Dunvegan; and as such it well deserved a less
sleepy inhabitant.”<a name="FNanchor_651_652" id="FNanchor_651_652"></a><a href="#Footnote_651_652" class="fnanchor">[651]</a> This account Sir Walter wrote many years
later from memory. The rocks which he saw were not Macleod’s
Maidens; from them he was separated by nearly ten miles of
mountains and lochs.</p>

<p>In the present drawing-room a small portrait of Johnson, ascribed<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">{195}</a></span>
to Reynolds, but, as I was told, by Zoffany, hangs in a place
of honour. Here, too, is kept his letter of thanks to Macleod,
endorsed “Dr. Johnston’s.” He wrote it “on the margin of the
sea, waiting for a boat and a wind. Boswell,” he continues “grows
impatient; but the kind treatment which I find wherever I go
makes me leave with some heaviness of heart an island which I am
not very likely to see again.” Among other treasures in the same
room is Rorie More’s horn, “a large cow’s horn, with the mouth of
it ornamented with silver curiously carved. It holds rather more
than a bottle and a half. Every laird of Macleod, it is said, must,
as a proof of his manhood, drink it off full of claret without laying
it down.” It is curious that Boswell makes no mention of the
ancient cup described by Scott in a note to the second canto of
<cite>The Lord of the Isles</cite>, or of the fairy flag. “Here,” writes Pennant,
“is preserved the <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Braolauch shi</i>, or fairy-flag of the family,
bestowed on it by the queen of the fairies. She blessed it with
powers of the first importance, which were to be exerted on only
three occasions; on the last, after the end was obtained, an invisible
being is to carry off standard and standard-bearer, never more to be
seen. The flag has been produced thrice. The first time in an
engagement against the Clan-Ronald, to whose sight the Macleods
were multiplied ten-fold; the second preserved the heir, being
then produced to save the longings of the lady; and the third
time to save my own; but it was so tattered, that Titania
did not seem to think it worth sending for. This was a superstition<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">{196}</a></span>
derived from the Norwegian ancestry of the house.”<a name="FNanchor_652_653" id="FNanchor_652_653"></a><a href="#Footnote_652_653" class="fnanchor">[652]</a> Sir
Walter describes it as “a pennon of silk, with something like
round red rowan-berries wrought upon it.”<a name="FNanchor_653_654" id="FNanchor_653_654"></a><a href="#Footnote_653_654" class="fnanchor">[653]</a> <span class="sidenote">RORIE MORE’S CLAYMORE.</span> In the gallery I saw
Rorie More’s claymore, “of a prodigious size,” as Boswell called
it. He wrote this some years before he heard from old Mr.
Edwards that Johnson, when an undergraduate of Oxford, “would
not let them say prodigious at college, for even then he was delicate
in language.” If it is not prodigious, nevertheless it is a real
<em>claymore</em> or <em>great sword</em>, for that is what the Gaelic word means.
Unfortunately the point is broken off. The sight of it did not
console me for my disappointment at finding that Rorie More’s bed
is no longer in existence, with the inscription above it, “Sir Roderick
M’Leod of Dunvegan, Knight. God send good rest.” I would
rather have seen it than a dozen swords, whether great or small.</p>

<p>Johnson slept in the Fairy Bedroom in the Fairy Tower. The
legend runs that this part of the castle was built 450 years ago by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">{197}</a></span>
that very uncommon being, a fairy grandmother. Godmothers
among the fairies have often been heard of, but grandmothers, we
believe, never before or since. Had Puck peeped in and seen
Johnson wearing his wig turned inside out and the wrong end in
front as a substitute for a night-cap,<a name="FNanchor_654_655" id="FNanchor_654_655"></a><a href="#Footnote_654_655" class="fnanchor">[654]</a> he might well have exclaimed
that his mistress kept a monster, not only near but in “her close
and consecrated bower.” From this room a winding stone staircase
led up to the battlements, but without mounting so high Johnson
commanded a fine view. From his window he could see, far
away across the lochs, Macleod’s Tables, two lofty hills with round
flat tops, which on all sides form a striking landmark. Much
nearer was the Gallows Hill, where in the bad old times many a
poor wretch, dragged from his dark and dismal dungeon, caught
his last sight of loch and mountain and heath, doomed to death by
the laird. Only thirty-three years before our travellers’ visit a man
was hanged there by the grandfather of their host. He was a
Macdonald who had murdered his father, and escaped into Macleod’s
country. But the old tribal feuds were long since over, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">{198}</a></span>
he found no safety there. At Macdonald’s request he was at once
seized and hanged.<a name="FNanchor_655_656" id="FNanchor_655_656"></a><a href="#Footnote_655_656" class="fnanchor">[655]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">DUNGEONS AND PIT.</div>

<p>The dungeons and the pit are not described by either Boswell
or Johnson, though the sight of them, we would willingly believe,
must have roused their indignation. In these old castles there are
few things more shocking than the close neighbourhood of festivity
and misery. It shows a callousness to human suffering which
almost passes belief. If a prisoner is in a remote part of a great
castle, the imagination then must come into play to bring his
sufferings before the mind; but when he is close at hand, when
his sorrowful sighing is only kept by the thickness of a single wall
from mingling with the prattle of children and the merriment of
feasters, then the heart must be hard indeed which is not touched.
At Dunvegan a door to the left opened into a pleasant sitting-room,
and to the right into the chief dungeon. In it there was no window,
not even one of those narrow slits by which a few rays can struggle
in. But there was something worse even than the dungeon. In
the floor there was an opening by which the unhappy prisoner
could be lowered into a deep-pit. Here he would dwell in ever-during
dark, never cheered by the hurried glimpse of daylight such
as broke the long night in the prison above whenever the jailer
paid his visit. The door of the other dungeon&mdash;for there was yet
another&mdash;is in the wall of a bedroom, which is furnished in so old
a style that it is likely enough that the curious bed and hangings
were gazed at by many a prisoner as he was hurried by.</p>

<p>As we wandered through these old rooms and staircases and
passages, we were told of a poor woman from St. Kilda, who like
ourselves was shown over the castle. As she went on she became
so bewildered by the number of the rooms, that she begged to be
allowed to keep fast hold of the hand of the person who was conducting
her, for fear she might get lost and never find her way out.
The story called to my mind a man from the same remote island
mentioned by Martin. He was taken to Glasgow, and though in
those days it was but a small town, nevertheless he was so much
scared that in like manner he clung to his guide’s hand as long as
he was in the streets.<a name="FNanchor_656_657" id="FNanchor_656_657"></a><a href="#Footnote_656_657" class="fnanchor">[656]</a> The poor woman must have breathed more
freely when she at length reached the court-yard and looked out
over the familiar sea. The platform, then, no doubt was rough<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">{199}</a></span>
with stone, but now it is soft with green turf. I looked there for
the false stone cannons which Boswell mentions, but I learnt that
they had been moved to the top of one of the towers. In their
place are some of iron, venerable by their antiquity, but unfit for
service. Against one of the low walls which enclose this pleasant
court leans a piece of old sculpture, the effigy probably of some
lady of the family.</p>

<div class="sidenote">ISLAND ISA.</div>

<p>Three or four miles down the loch, and out of sight of the
castle, lies the little island of Isa or Issay, “which Macleod said he
would give to Dr. Johnson, on
condition of his residing on it
three months in the year; nay,
one month. Dr. Johnson was
highly amused with the fancy.
He talked a great deal of this
island; how he would build a
house there&mdash;how he would
fortify it&mdash;how he would have
cannon&mdash;how he would plant&mdash;how
he would sally out, and
<em>take</em> the Isle of Muck; and then
he laughed with uncommon
glee, and could hardly leave off.
Macleod encouraged the fancy
of Dr. Johnson’s becoming
owner of an island; told him
that it was the practice in that
country to name every man by
his lands, and begged leave to
drink to him in that mode, ‘<em>Island Isa</em>, your health.’ Ulinish,
Talisker, M’Queen, and I all joined in our different manners, while
Dr. Johnson bowed to each with much good humour.” To Mrs.
Thrale he wrote: “Macleod has offered me an island; if it were
not too far off I should hardly refuse it; my island would be
pleasanter than Brighthelmstone if you and my master could come
to it; but I cannot think it pleasant to live quite alone,</p>

</div>

<p>Much as he wished to visit it, he was hindered even from seeing it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">{200}</a></span>
by the stormy weather. We were more fortunate, for though we
did not land, yet we saw it from the high ground on the opposite
shore. The greater part of the way to this spot a rough road has
been made along which we drove, passing a great heronry. It
was curious to watch the huge nests and the great birds in the
trees. For nearly three miles of country they were the chief
inhabitants. <em>Island Isa</em> would certainly have lived in great
solitude, for after we had passed the gamekeeper’s cottage close to
the castle, we saw no signs of habitation except the herons’ nests,
till we reached a farm-house nearly three miles off. Here the road
ended. In the little garden stood some large laburnum trees, all
drooping with their golden flowers. Our way led across a wide
heath to a fine breezy
headland. Below us
another stretch of
heath-land sloped
down to the shore of
the loch. On the
other side of a narrow
channel lay Isa, with
fine rocky cliffs to the
west and the north,
but lying open to the
south-east. It was
Midsummer Day.
The sea was calm, a
blue haze softened the outline of the neighbouring hills, but let the
mountains in the farther Hebrides be but faintly seen. The little
isle lay before us with no signs on it of human habitation. Buchanan
describes it as “fertilis frugum,”<a name="FNanchor_658_659" id="FNanchor_658_659"></a><a href="#Footnote_658_659" class="fnanchor">[658]</a> and Martin says that it was
“fruitful in corn;”<a name="FNanchor_659_660" id="FNanchor_659_660"></a><a href="#Footnote_659_660" class="fnanchor">[659]</a> but it must be many a year since the plough
turned up its soil. It is a land of pastures. In the hot, drowsy
air there was nothing but the song of the lark and the bleating
of the lambs “to break the silence of the seas.” Far below us
a shepherd with his two dogs was gathering a small flock of sheep.
They, and the larks, and the sea-birds were the only things that
seemed alive. We had reached, as it were, the antipodes of “that
full tide of human existence” in which Johnson delighted. For
not a single day would he have endured the lonely dignity of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">{201}</a></span>
such a domain. The road to the headland had not been quite
free from danger, for on our return we found coiled up asleep on
the path half hidden in the heather an adder. It was killed by a
blow of a stick which I had brought with me from Corsica.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">GATHERING OF THE CONGREGATIONS.</div>

<p>On the Sunday, which we spent at Dunvegan, we chanced to
see a sight interesting in itself, but doubly so to anyone who came
from the South. The Free Kirk congregations of three parishes
met in a field to take the Sacrament. It was one of the three great
religious gatherings of the year, and the people flocked in from all
the country side. Many came by water from far-off glens that
sloped down to the sea. From the windows of our inn we watched
the heavy boats fully laden coming round a distant point, and
rowing slowly up to a ledge of rocks just below us. In one we
counted twenty-one people. Women as well as men tugged at the
oars, and when the boat was run aground helped to drag it up the
beach. When this was done, they all set about completing their
toilettes. The beach served them for their tiring-house, though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">{202}</a></span>
it was a good deal more open to view than a hawthorn-brake. In
one of the boats we had noticed a man distinguished from all the
rest by a tall black hat, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">pietate gravem ac meritis</i>. To him had
been entrusted the clean white collars and neckties of the rowers.
Many of the men knelt down while their wives fastened them on
for them and smoothed their hair. One man even went so far as
to put on his shirt in public. The women too, who were almost
all in black, had their dresses to arrange, for in the boats they had
kept their skirts tucked up. Some of the girls even had to get
their bustles adjusted. Carlyle or his wife once made merry over
their maid-of-all-work at Chelsea, who with two or three kitchen-dusters
made the best substitute she could for that monstrous and
most “considerable protuberance.” What would he have said had
he seen the lasses in Skye thus making themselves as ridiculous as
even the finest lady in town?</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">A FIELD CONVENTICLE.</div>

<p>When at length every one was ready, the whole party moved
slowly along the road towards the church. Others came driving
up in light and heavy carts, while across the moors we could see
single wayfarers, or more often three or four together, coming in
by different paths. There was greeting of old friends and shaking
of hands. The church stood on the road-side, a plain building
with the manse close by. In it was gathered that part of the
congregation which spoke English. On the other side of the road
the ground fell away to a little brook which had eaten its way
through the dark-coloured peat, and here made a sudden bend.
On the other side of the water, within the bend, there was a grassy
slope ending in a low ridge, and dotted with little hillocks. Here
the people sat down on the ground, facing an erection which
looked like a large sentry-box. It was occupied by the minister,
who addressed the people in Gaelic, speaking in a kind of musical
recitative which carried the voice far, and must have made every
syllable distinct. It often had a very pleading and plaintive sound.
Below him stood two long rows of tables, and a cross table, all
covered with white cloths. On the other side of the stream by the
roadside twenty carts or more were standing, while the horses
were quietly grazing on the moor tethered each to an iron peg.
One horse nibbled through the cord, and came up to the outskirts
of the meeting, but a lad left his seat and caught it. In the background
the dreary moorland sloped upwards, blackened here and
there with heaps of peat drying in the sun and wind. I thought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">{203}</a></span>
how in the old days watchers would have been posted on the most
distant ridges to give warning of the approach of the persecutors.
How many people were gathered together I do not know&mdash;certainly
many hundreds, perhaps a thousand. <span class="sidenote">NATIONAL COSTUMES.</span> All were decently,
though some poorly dressed. Almost all had good warm clothing,
with strong boots and shoes, none of them in holes. Very many
of the women had tartan shawls, and one or two boys wore the
kilt. One man I saw with tartan stockings, but the dress of all
the rest differed in no respect from that worn in England. In
costumes an act of uniformity seems to have been passed not only
for the British Isles, but also for Western Europe in general.
Travelling is losing part of its interest by the great sameness in
clothing everywhere met with. There will soon, I fear, be no
country left which can boast of a national dress. Though the
meeting was out of doors, yet all were decent and sober in their
behaviour. There was no talking or giggling, no fringe of rude
lads and silly girls. Where the little moorland path ended that
led from the church a table was set, on which stood a large metal
basin to receive the offerings. Every one seemed to put in something,
even the poorest, but in the great pile of pence and half-pence
I saw but one piece of silver. When the service in the
church was over, the minister and people joined those on the
moor, for it was there that the Sacrament was taken by both<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">{204}</a></span>
congregations together. The service began between eleven and
twelve o’clock. Soon after four we saw the people come trooping
down to the shore. The boats were launched, sails were set, and
with a gentle breeze they were slowly carried down the loch and
round the headland out of our sight.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DR. JOHNSON’S CUPS OF TEA.</div>

<p>On the morning of Tuesday, September 21, our travellers took
advantage of a break in the stormy weather to continue their
journey to Ulinish, a farm-house on Loch Bracadale, occupied by
“a plain honest gentleman,” the Sheriff-substitute of the island.
Here they passed the night, and here, if we may trust report,
Johnson’s powers as a drinker of tea were exerted to their utmost
pitch. “Mrs. Macleod of Ulinish,” writes Knox, “has not forgotten
the quantity of tea which she filled out to Dr. Johnson,
amounting to twenty-two dishes.”<a name="FNanchor_660_661" id="FNanchor_660_661"></a><a href="#Footnote_660_661" class="fnanchor">[660]</a> Surely for this outrageous
statement some of those excuses are needed “by which,” according
to Boswell, “the exaggeration of Highland narratives is palliated.”
From an old tower near the house a fine view was had of the
Cuillin, or Cuchullin Hills, “a prodigious range of mountains,
capped with rocky pinnacles in a strange variety of shapes,” which
with good reason reminded Boswell of the mountains he had seen
near Corte in Corsica.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_205" id="Page_205">{205}</a></span></p>

<div class="sidenote">A GREAT CAVE.</div>

<p>On the afternoon of the following day “an interval of calm
sunshine,” writes Johnson, “courted us out to see a cave on the
shore famous for its echo. When we went into the boat one of
our companions was asked in Erse by the boatmen who they were
that came with him. He gave us characters, I suppose, to our
advantage, and was asked in the spirit of the Highlands whether I
could recite a long series of ancestors. The boatmen said, as I
perceived afterwards, that they heard the cry of an English ghost.
This, Boswell says, disturbed him. We came to the cave, and
clambering up the rocks came to an arch open at one end, one
hundred and eighty feet long, thirty broad in the broadest part, and
about thirty feet high. There was no echo; such is the fidelity of
reports; but I saw what I had never seen before, mussels and
whelks in their natural state. There was another arch in the rock
open at both ends.” This cave was not on the shore of Skye, as
Johnson’s account seems to imply, but in the little island of Wia.
From Boswell we learn that it was to an island they were taken.
We were fortunate enough on our visit to this wild part of the
coast to have as our guide one of Macleod’s gamekeepers. “A
man,” to borrow from Johnson the praise which he bestowed on
one of his guides, “of great liveliness and activity, civil and ready-handed.”<a name="FNanchor_661_662" id="FNanchor_661_662"></a><a href="#Footnote_661_662" class="fnanchor">[661]</a>
We had passed the night in the lonely little inn at
Struan on the shore of an arm of Loch Bracadale, where we had
found decent, if homely, lodging. In a fisherman’s boat we rowed
down the loch, sometimes in mid-channel and sometimes skirting the
cliffs, which rose like a wall of rock to a great height above us. We
passed little islets, and the mouths of caverns which filled with
clouds of spray as the long rolling waves swept in from the Atlantic.
On the ledges of the rocks, hovering over our heads, swimming
and diving in the sea, were cormorants, puffins, oyster catchers,
gulls, curlews and guillemots. We had none of us looked upon a
wilder scene. When we reached our island we were pleased to find
that the narrow beach at which we were to land was guarded by a
huge headland from the swell of the sea. Whether we visited the
cave which our travellers saw I do not feel at all sure, for it does
not correspond with their description. My friend, the gamekeeper,
was sure that it was the place, and I was willing to advance my
faith more than half-way to meet his assertion. We scrambled up<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_206" id="Page_206">{206}</a></span>
the steep beach, and then over rocks covered with grass and ferns,
between the sides of a narrow gorge. At the top a still steeper
path led downwards to a cave, at the bottom of which we could see
a glimmer of light. Scrambling upwards again, we reached a
place where we could hear the sea murmuring on the other side.
We afterwards climbed to the top of the cliff and sat down on the
ground which formed the roof of the cavern. It was covered with
heather and ferns, and patches of short grass; a pleasant breeze
was blowing, the sea birds were uttering their cries, far beneath us
we could hear the beating of the surge. Across the Loch on both
sides, the dark cliffs rose to a great height, and in the background
stood the mountains of Skye and of the mainland. Had the air
been very clear, we might have seen on the north-west the wooded
hills of Dunvegan.</p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCE CHARLIE’S CAVES.</div>

<p>Two or three days later, when I was giving two Highlanders
an account of this cavern, one of them asked with a humorous
smile: “Did they not tell you it was Prince Charlie’s Cave? He
must, I am thinking, have been sleeping everywhere.” His
companion laughed and said: “They have lately made a new one
near an hotel which they have opened at &mdash;&mdash;.” The innkeepers
should surely show a little originality. Why should they not
advertise Dr. Johnson’s Cave, and show the tea-pot out of which
he drank his two-and-twenty cups of tea when he picnicked there?
They would do well also to discover the great cave in Skye which
Martin tells of. “It is supposed,” he writes, “to exceed a mile in
length. The natives told me that a piper who was over-curious
went in with a design to find out the length of it, and after he
entered began to play on his pipe, but never returned to give
an account of his progress.”<a name="FNanchor_662_663" id="FNanchor_662_663"></a><a href="#Footnote_662_663" class="fnanchor">[662]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE SAIL TO TALISKER.</div>

<p>From Ulinish our travellers sailed up Loch Bracadale on their
way to Talisker. “We had,” says Boswell, “good weather and a
fine sail. The shore was varied with hills, and rocks, and corn-fields,
and bushes, which are here dignified with the name of
natural <em>wood</em>.” They landed at Ferneley, a farm-house about
three miles from Talisker, whither they made their way over the
hills, Johnson on horseback, the rest on foot. The weather, no
doubt, had been too uncertain for them to venture into the open sea
round the great headland at the entrance of the loch. Skirting the
stern and rock-bound coast, a few miles’ sail would have brought<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_207" id="Page_207">{207}</a></span>
them to Talisker Bay, within sight of Colonel Macleod’s house.
Yet, had the wind risen, or had there been a swell from the
Atlantic, they would have been forced to keep out to sea. Boswell
describes “the prodigious force and noise with which the billows
break on the shore.” “It is,” says Johnson, “a coast where no
vessel lands but when it is driven by a tempest on the rocks.”
Only two nights before his arrival two boats had been wrecked
there in a storm. “The crews crept to Talisker almost lifeless
with wet, cold, fatigue, and terror.” What could not be safely done
near the end of September, might, we thought, be hazarded in
June. As the day was fine and we had a good sea-boat, an
old fisherman to manage it, our trusty gamekeeper to help in
rowing, and an accomplished yachtsman in our artist, we boldly
sailed forth into the Atlantic. We passed in sight of Macleod’s
Maidens, beneath rocks such as Mr. Brett and Mr. Graham
delight to paint. In one spot we were shown where, a few years
before, a huge mass had come tumbling down. At the entrance to
the Bay we passed through a narrow channel in the rocks with the
waves foaming on each side. <span class="sidenote">TALISKER BAY.</span> Even our stout-hearted gamekeeper<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_208" id="Page_208">{208}</a></span>
for a moment looked uneasy, but with a few strong strokes
of the oars the worst was past, and we were out of the broken
waters, and in full sight of the little bay with its beach of great
black stones, its rugged and steep headlands, and its needle
rocks, with one of the sunniest of valleys for its background.
Johnson thought it “the place, beyond all he had seen, from
which the gay and the jovial seem utterly excluded; and where
the hermit might grow old in meditation without possibility
of disturbance or interruption.” To us
on that fine June day, with the haze
lying on the hills, it was as if</p>

<p>Boswell had counted “fifteen different waterfalls near the house in
the space of about a quarter of a mile.” “They succeeded one
another so fast,” said Johnson, “that as one ceased to be heard
another began.” This one thing was wanting on that beautiful
afternoon which we spent in this delightful spot. The voice of
the cascades was still. There were no waterfalls streaming down<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">{209}</a></span>
the lofty hills. One indeed we found by following the course of
a river up a fine glen, but owing to the long drought its roar had
sunk into a murmur.</p>

<div class="sidenote">COLONEL MACLEOD OF TALISKER.</div>

<p>Johnson’s host, Colonel Macleod, was the good kinsman who
had befriended the young Laird in the troubles which he encountered
on his succession to the property.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He had,” writes Boswell, “been bred to physic, had a tincture of scholarship
in his conversation, which pleased Dr. Johnson, and he had some very good books;
and being a colonel in the Dutch service, he and his lady, in consequence of having
lived abroad, had introduced the ease and politeness of the continent into this rude
region.”</p></div>

<p>Pennant, writing in the year 1774, thus describes these Scotch
regiments in the Dutch service:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They were formed out of some independent companies sent over either in the
reign of Elizabeth or James VI. At present the common men are but nominally
national, for since the scarcity of men occasioned by the late war, Holland is no
longer permitted to draw her recruits out of North Britain. But the officers are all
Scotch, who are obliged to take oaths to our government, and to qualify in presence
of our ambassador at the Hague.”<a name="FNanchor_663_664" id="FNanchor_663_664"></a><a href="#Footnote_663_664" class="fnanchor">[663]</a></p></div>

<p>In the war which broke out between England and Holland in
1781, this curious system, which had survived the great naval
battles between the two countries in the seventeenth century, at last
came to an end. In the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> for December,
1782, we read, that on the first of that month:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The Scotch Brigade in the Dutch service renounced their allegiance to their
lawful Sovereign, and took a new oath of fidelity to their High Mightinesses. They
are for the future to wear the Dutch uniform, and not to carry the arms of the
enemy any longer in their colours, nor to beat their march. They are to receive the
word of command in Dutch, and their officers are to wear orange-coloured sashes,
and the same sort of spontoons as the officers of other Dutch regiments.”<a name="FNanchor_664_665" id="FNanchor_664_665"></a><a href="#Footnote_664_665" class="fnanchor">[664]</a></p></div>

<p>Colonel Macleod, if he was still living, lost, of course, his command.
At the time of our travellers’ visit he was on leave of
absence, which had been extended for some years, says Johnson,
“in this time of universal peace.” The knowledge which he had
gained in Holland he turned to good account in Skye. <span class="sidenote">THE GARDEN AT TALISKER.</span> He both
drained the land which lay at the foot of the mountains round
Talisker, and made a good garden. “He had been,” says Knox,
“an observer of Dutch improvements. He carried off in proper
channels the waters of two rivers which often deluged the bottom.
He divided the whole valley by deep and sometimes wide ditches
into a number of square fields and meadows. He now enjoys the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_210" id="Page_210">{210}</a></span>
fruits of his ingenuity in the quantity of grain and hay raised
thereon.” He had made it “the seat of plenty, hospitality, and
good nature.”<a name="FNanchor_665_666" id="FNanchor_665_666"></a><a href="#Footnote_665_666" class="fnanchor">[665]</a> To few places in our islands could Dutch art have
been transplanted where it would find nature more kindly. Johnson
noticed the prosperous growth of the trees, which, though they
were not many years old, were already very high and thick.
Could he have seen them at the present day he would have owned
that even in the garden of an Oxford College there are few finer.
The soil is so good, we were told, “that things have only to be
planted and they grow.” So sheltered from all the cold winds is
the position, and so great is the warmth diffused by the beneficent
Gulf Stream, that the whole year round flowers live out of doors
which anywhere but on the southern coasts of Devonshire and
Cornwall would be killed by the frosts. The garden is delightfully
old-fashioned, entirely free from the dismal formality of ribbon-borders.
Fruit trees, flowers, shrubs, and vegetables mingle
together. It lies open to the south-west, being enclosed on the
other sides with groves of trees. A lawn shaded by a noble
sycamore stretches up to the house. Boswell would have been
pleased to find that smooth turf now covers the court which in his
time was “most injudiciously paved with round blueish-grey
pebbles, upon which you walked as if upon cannon-balls driven into
the ground.” The house “in its snug corner” has been greatly
enlarged, but the old building still remains. Unfortunately no
tradition has been preserved of the room occupied by Johnson.
Much as he admired this sequestered spot&mdash;“a place where the
imagination is more amused cannot easily be found,” he said&mdash;nevertheless
it was here that he quoted to Boswell the lines of the
song:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Every island is a prison</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Strongly guarded by the sea;</div>
<div class="verse">Kings and princes, for that reason,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">Prisoners are as well as we.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>If Talisker is a prison, it is a goodly one. There are few places
which linger more pleasantly in my memory. To the beauty of
the scenery and the delightfulness of the weather was added the
hospitality which we received from our kind hostess, Mrs. Cameron.
Time, alas, failed us to climb “the very high rocky hill” at the
back of the house, whence Boswell had “a view of Barra, the Long<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_211" id="Page_211">{211}</a></span>
Island, Bernera, the Loch of Dunvegan, part of Rum, part of
Raasay, and a vast deal of the Isle of Skye.” According to
Pennant, who had made the ascent the year before:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It has in front a fine series of genuine basaltic columns, resembling the Giant’s
Causeway. The ruins of the columns at the base made a grand appearance; they
were the ruins of the creation. This is the most northern basalt I am acquainted
with; the last of four, all running from south to north&mdash;the Giant’s Causeway,
Staffa, the rock Humbla, and Briis-mhawl. The depth of ocean in all probability
conceals the lost links of this chain.”<a name="FNanchor_666_667" id="FNanchor_666_667"></a><a href="#Footnote_666_667" class="fnanchor">[666]</a></p></div>

<p>This mountain, which he calls Briis-mhawl, in Boswell’s narrative
appears as Prieshwell.</p>

<p class="floatc">SLIGACHAN THE CUCHUILLIN HILLS SKYE</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">A RIDE ACROSS SKYE.</div>

<p>At Talisker Johnson made the acquaintance of young Macleane
of Col, that amiable man whose death by drowning the following
year he so much lamented. Under his guidance, taking leave of
their kind hosts, they rode across the island to Sconser, on the
coast opposite to Raasay. Of this part of their journey they tell us
next to nothing, though they passed through the wildest scenery.
For the first two or three miles their path wound up a valley that
is not unworthy of the most delightful parts of Cumberland. It is
altogether free from the utter desolation which casts a gloom over
so much of Skye. The sloping sides of the hills are covered with
short grass and fragrant herbs. All about in summer time are
dotted the sheep and lambs, answering each other with their bleats.
When we travelled along this way we passed a band of five-and-twenty
shearers who had been hard at work for many days. The
farm of Talisker keeps a winter stock of between five and six
thousand Cheviot sheep, and the clipping takes a long time.
Dropping into the valley on the other side of the hills the road
leads beyond the head of Loch Harport across the island to
Sligachan, where amidst gloomy waste now stands a comfortable
hotel. In the little garden which surrounds it is the only trace
of cultivation to be anywhere seen. It would have seemed impossible
to add anything to the dreariness of the scenery; nevertheless
something has been added by the long line of gaunt
telegraph posts which stretches across the moor. Perhaps at this
spot stood the little hut where our travellers made a short halt, as
they watched an old woman grinding at the <em>quern</em>. With one hand
she rapidly turned round the uppermost of two mill-stones, while
with the other she poured in the corn through a hole pierced<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">{212}</a></span>
through it. A ride of a few more miles brought the party, through
the gloom of evening, to Sconser, where they dined at the little
inn.</p>

<div class="sidenote">RETURN TO CORRICHATACHIN</div>

<p>At Sconser our travellers took boat for Strolimus, on their way
to the friendly farmhouse at Corrichatachin, where they had been
so hospitably received nearly three weeks earlier. Their horses
they sent round a point of land to meet them further down the
coast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was seven o’clock,” writes Boswell, “when we got into our boat. We had
many showers, and it soon grew pretty dark. Dr. Johnson sat silent and patient.
Once he said, as he looked on the black coast of Skye&mdash;black, as being composed
of rocks seen in the dusk&mdash;‘This is very solemn.’ Our boatmen were rude singers,
and seemed so like wild Indians, that a very little imagination was necessary to give
one an impression of being upon an American river. We landed at Strolimus, from
whence we got a guide to walk before us, for two miles, to Corrichatachin. Not
being able to procure a horse for our baggage, I took one portmanteau before me,
and Joseph another. We had but a single star to light us on our way. It was about
eleven when we arrived. We were most hospitably received by the master and
mistress, who were just going to bed, but, with unaffected ready kindness, made a
good fire, and at twelve o’clock at night had supper on the table.”</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>SAILING PAST THE ISLE OF RUM.</p></div>
</div>

<div class="sidenote">WEATHER-BOUND AT OSTIG.</div>

<p>Here, as I have already described, they rested that twentieth
Sunday after Trinity, when Boswell, recovering from his drinking
bout, “by divine interposition, as some would have taken it,”
opened his Prayer Book at the Apostles’ injunction against drunkenness
contained in the Epistle for that day. Here, too, the Highlanders,
drinking their toasts over the punch, won by Johnson’s easy
and social manners, “vied with each other in crying out, with a
strong Celtic pronunciation, ‘Toctor Shonson, Toctor Shonson,
your health!’” The weather was so stormy that it was not till the
afternoon of Tuesday, September 28, that they were able to
continue their journey. That night they arrived at Ostig, on the
north-western side of the promontory of Slate, and found a hospitable
reception at the Manse. Here, too, they were kept prisoners
by wind and rain. “I am,” writes Johnson, “still confined in Skye.
We were unskilful travellers, and imagined that the sea was an
open road which we could pass at pleasure; but we have now
learned with some pain that we may still wait for a long time the
caprices of the equinoctial winds, and sit reading or writing, as I
now do, while the tempest is rolling the sea or roaring in the mountains.”
Nevertheless, so good was the entertainment which they
received that, as Boswell tells us, “the hours slipped along imperceptibly.”
They had books, and company, and conversation. In<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_214" id="Page_214">{214}</a></span>
strange contrast to the wildness of the scenery and the roughness
of the weather was their talk one day about Shenstone and his
Love Pastorals. It was surely not among the stormy Hebrides
that the poet of the Leasowes, whose “ambition was rural elegance,”
would have expected to be quoted. Yet here it was, in the midst
of beating winds and dashing showers, with the storm-tossed sea in
view of the windows, that Boswell repeated the pretty stanza:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“She gazed as I slowly withdrew;</div>
<div class="verse indent2">My path I could hardly discern;</div>
<div class="verse">So sweetly she bade me adieu,</div>
<div class="verse indent2">I thought that she bade me return.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<img src="images/illus_105.jpg" width="300" height="238" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>ARDNAMURCHAN POINT.</p></div>
</div>

<p>On Friday, October 1, they took advantage of a break in the
weather to move on
to Armidale, about a
mile from the Sound
of Slate, where they
waited for a favourable
wind to carry
them to Iona. It
came, or rather
seemed to come, on
the following Sunday.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SETTING SAIL FOR IONA.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“While we were chatting,”
writes Boswell, “in
the indolent style of men
who were to stay here all
this day at least, we were
suddenly roused at being told that the wind was fair, that a little fleet of herring-busses
was passing by for Mull, and that Mr. Simpson’s vessel was about to sail.
Hugh M’Donald, the skipper, came to us, and was impatient that we should get
ready, which we soon did. Dr. Johnson, with composure and solemnity, repeated
the observation of Epictetus, that ‘as man has the voyage of death before him,
whatever may be his employment, he should be ready at the master’s call; and an
old man should never be far from the shore, lest he should not be able to get himself
ready.’”</p></div>

<p>For some hours they sailed along with a favourable breeze,
catching sight of the Isle of Rum as they rounded the point; but
when they had got in full view of Ardnamurchan, the wind changed. <span class="sidenote">THE ISLAND OF COL.</span> They tried tacking, but a storm broke upon them, night came on,
and they were forced to run through the darkness for Col. Boswell’s
account of this dangerous voyage is too long to quote, and too good<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_215" id="Page_215">{215}</a></span>
to abridge. In this dreary spot they were weather-bound for more
than a week. “There is,” writes Johnson, “literally no tree upon the
island; part of it is a sandy waste, over which it would be really
dangerous to travel in dry weather, and with a high wind.” The
sight of these hills of sand struck him greatly. “I heard him,”
writes Boswell, “after we were in the house, repeating to himself,
as he walked about the room,</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘And smothered in the dusty whirlwind dies.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="figcenter w500">

<div class="caption"><p>COL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Over this low-lying island the Atlantic blasts swept in all their
fury. On Sunday October 10, Boswell recorded:&mdash;“There was this
day the most terrible storm of wind and rain that I ever remember.
It made such an awful impression on us all, as to produce, for some
time, a kind of dismal quietness in the house.”</p>

<p>The rough weather spread far. In London, as the old weather
tables tell us, it was “a stormy day with heavy rains and with little
intermission night and day.”<a name="FNanchor_667_668" id="FNanchor_667_668"></a><a href="#Footnote_667_668" class="fnanchor">[667]</a> On the previous Friday Horace
Walpole had come home in a tempest from Bushey Park. “I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_216" id="Page_216">{216}</a></span>
hope,” he wrote, “Jupiter Pluvius has not been so constant at
Ampthill. I think he ought to be engraved at the top of every map
of England.”<a name="FNanchor_668_669" id="FNanchor_668_669"></a><a href="#Footnote_668_669" class="fnanchor">[668]</a> Happily in the young Laird of Col our travellers had
the kindest of hosts. His house “new-built and neat” still stands;
Grissipol, which they visited, is in ruins. It was not till the morning
of Thursday, the 14th, that they were able to set sail. With a
fair breeze they were soon carried over to Tobermory, or Mary’s
Well, a beautiful bay in the Isle of Mull.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are (writes Boswell) sometimes sixty or seventy sail here: to-day there
were twelve or fourteen vessels. To see such a fleet was the next thing to seeing a
town. The vessels were from different places; Clyde, Campbeltown, Newcastle, &amp;c.
One was returning to Lancaster from Hamburgh. After having been shut up so long
in Col, the sight of such an assemblage of moving habitations, containing such
a variety of people engaged in different pursuits, gave me much gaiety of spirit.
When we had landed, Dr. Johnson said, ‘Boswell is now all alive. He is like
Antæus; he gets new vigour whenever he touches the ground.’”</p></div>

<div class="caption"><p>COL: THE LAIRD’S HOUSE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>No such fleet is, I imagine, ever to be seen there at the present
day, for one steamer does the work of many small vessels. The
beauty of this little haven has been long celebrated. Sacheverell,
who visited it two hundred years ago, thus describes it:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To the landward it is surrounded with high mountains covered with woods,
pleasantly intermixed with rocks, and three or four cascades of water, which throw
themselves from the top of the mountain with a pleasure that is astonishing, all which
together make one of the oddest and most charming prospects I ever saw. Italy
itself, with all the assistance of art, can hardly afford anything more beautiful and
diverting.”<a name="FNanchor_669_670" id="FNanchor_669_670"></a><a href="#Footnote_669_670" class="fnanchor">[669]</a></p></div>

whose <cite>Description of the Western Isles</cite> was published the year after
Sacheverell’s book, gives the following account of this expedition:&mdash;</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“One of the ships of the Spanish Armada, called the Florida, perished in this
Bay, having been blown up by one Smallet, of Dumbarton, in the year 1588. There
was a great sum of gold and money on board, which disposed the Earl of Argyle and
some Englishmen to attempt the recovery of it. Some pieces of gold and money and
a golden chain was taken out of her. I have seen some fine brass cannon, some
pieces of eight, teeth, beads and pins that had been taken out of that ship. Several
of the inhabitants of Mull told me that they had conversed with their relations that
were living at the harbour when the ship was blown up.”<a name="FNanchor_670_671" id="FNanchor_670_671"></a><a href="#Footnote_670_671" class="fnanchor">[670]</a></p></div>

<p>“One Smallet” was an ancestor of the great novelist, who in his
<cite>Humphry Clinker</cite> artfully brings old Matthew Bramble to Tobermory
so that he may celebrate the great deed of his forefather.
According to his account
“the divers
found the hull of the
vessel still entire, but
so covered with sand
that they could not
make their way between
decks.”<a name="FNanchor_671_672" id="FNanchor_671_672"></a><a href="#Footnote_671_672" class="fnanchor">[671]</a> Mr.

did not know the name of the harbour.<a name="FNanchor_672_673" id="FNanchor_672_673"></a><a href="#Footnote_672_673" class="fnanchor">[672]</a> Sir Walter Scott, who
visited Tobermory a century and a quarter after Sacheverell, said
that, “the richness of the round steep green knolls, clothed
with copse and glancing with cascades, and a pleasant peep at a
small fresh-water loch embosomed among them&mdash;the view of the
bay surrounded and guarded by the island of Colvay&mdash;the gliding
of two or three vessels in the more distant sound&mdash;and the
row of the gigantic Ardnamurchan mountains closing the scene to
the north, almost justify his eulogium who in 1688 declared the Bay
of Tobermory might equal any prospect in Italy.”<a name="FNanchor_673_674" id="FNanchor_673_674"></a><a href="#Footnote_673_674" class="fnanchor">[673]</a> With one thing
Sacheverell was not content, and that was the weather. “With the
dog-days,” he says, “the autumnal rains began, and for six weeks
we had scarce a good day. The whole frame of nature seemed inhospitable,
bleak, stormy, rainy, windy.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_218" id="Page_218">{218}</a></span></p>

<p>There was a tolerable inn, where “a dish of tea and some good
bread and butter” restored Johnson’s good humour, which had been
somewhat ruffled by the miserable accommodation which he had had
on shipboard. They did not pass the night here, but became the
guests of a Dr. Macleane who lived close by. “Col,” wrote Johnson,
“made every Macleane open his house where we came, and
supply us with horses when we departed.” Here they were once
more kept prisoners by the weather. Not only was there wind and
rain, but the rivers, they were told, were impassable. They had
books and good talk. In the daughter of the house Johnson at last
found “an interpreter of Erse poetry.” At Dunvegan he complained
that “he could never get the meaning of a song explained
to him.” Miss Macleane had been bred in the Lowlands, and had
gained Gaelic by study. She therefore understood the exact nature
of his inquiries.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“She is [he said] the most accomplished lady that I have found in the Highlands.
She knows French, music, and drawing, sews neatly, makes shell-work, and can milk
cows; in short, she can do every thing. She talks sensibly, and is the first person
whom I have found, that can translate Erse poetry literally.”</p></div>

<p>On Saturday, October 16, the weather changed for the better,
owing to a new moon, as Boswell thought. A long day’s journey
lay before them, for they hoped to reach Inchkenneth, a little island
which lies at the mouth of Loch Na Keal, close to the western
coast of Mull. Here they were to be the guest of Sir Allan
Macleane.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A DOLOROUS COUNTRY.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We set out [writes Boswell] mounted on little Mull horses. Dr. Johnson was
not in very good humour. He said, it was a dreary country, much worse than Skye. I
differed from him. ‘O, Sir,’ said he, ‘a most dolorous country!’ We had a very
hard journey. I had no bridle for my sheltie, but only a halter; and Joseph rode
without a saddle. At one place, a loch having swelled over the road, we were
obliged to plunge through pretty deep water. Dr. Johnson observed, how helpless a
man would be, were he travelling here alone, and should meet with any accident;
and said, ‘he longed to get to a <em>country of saddles and bridles</em>.’”</p></div>

<p>When he called the country “most dolorous” he had no doubt
in mind the lines which describe the march of “the adventurous
bands” in <cite>Paradise Lost</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">

<div class="sidenote">A WEARY RIDE.</div>

<p>Writing to Mrs. Thrale he speaks of this day’s journey “as difficult
and tedious over rocks naked and valleys untracked through a
country of barrenness and solitude. We came almost in the dark
to the sea side, weary and dejected, having met with nothing but
water falling from the mountains that could raise any image of delight.”
Sacheverell had found the same ride no less gloomy.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We proceeded on our journey [he writes] over a country broken, rocky, boggy,
barren, and almost wholly unarable. Wet and weary at last we came to a Change-House
(so they call a house of entertainment); if a place that had neither
bed, victuals, or drink may be allowed that name. Our servants cut us green fern,
wet as it was, for bedding. We set forward early next morning. If I thought the

<p>Our travellers made their way so slowly over this rough country<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_220" id="Page_220">{220}</a></span>
that though they started at eleven, they did not reach the coast till
seven at night. Yet they had been told that the distance was but
eight miles. To add to the gloom, it was here that Johnson discovered
that he had lost that famous piece of timber, his huge oak-stick. <span class="sidenote">THE CHIEF OF ULVA’S ISLE.</span> Seeing how late it was, Col, who throughout had been their
guide, “determined that they should pass the night at Macquarrie’s,
in the Island of Ulva, which lies between Mull and Inchkenneth.”
The ferry-boat unfortunately was on the other side of the narrow
channel. The wind was so high that their shouts could not be
heard, and the darkness was too great for their signals to be seen.
They might have been forced to spend the night on the shore had
there not chanced to be lying in the little Sound of Ulva a ship
from Londonderry. In its long-boat they were ferried over.
In this same Sound less than a year later, on the night of
September 25, 1774, poor Col lost his life. “His boat,” says Sir
Walter Scott, “was swamped by the intoxication of the sailors, who
had partaken too largely of Macquarrie’s wonted hospitality.”
Here, perhaps, the Macleanes will some day set up a memorial to
the unhappy youth. “Col does every thing for us,” said Johnson:
“We will erect a statue to Col. He is a noble animal. He is as
complete an islander as the mind can figure. He is a farmer,
a sailor, a hunter, a fisher; he will run you down a dog; if any man
has a tail, it is Col. He is hospitable; and he has an intrepidity
of talk whether he understands the subject or not.” His untimely
end was regretted by those who only knew “this amiable man” by
the reports of our two travellers. “At the death of Col,” said
Boswell, “my wife wept much.”<a name="FNanchor_675_676" id="FNanchor_675_676"></a><a href="#Footnote_675_676" class="fnanchor">[675]</a> “There is great lamentation
here,” wrote Johnson from Lichfield, “for the death of Col. Lucy
is of opinion that he was wonderfully handsome.” Though they
were in the land of second-sight there was no shadow thrown
by coming events on the very liberal entertainment provided by
their host. Nevertheless the Chief of Ulva’s Isle had a sea
of troubles of his own to oppose. He was almost overwhelmed
with the stormy waters, not of Loch Gyle, but of debt. “His
ancestors,” wrote Johnson to Mrs. Thrale, “had reigned in Ulva
beyond memory, but he has reduced himself by his negligence and
folly to the necessity of selling this venerable patrimony.” His
house was a strange mixture of luxury and squalor. The room
in which Johnson slept was unboarded, and through a broken<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_221" id="Page_221">{221}</a></span>
window the rain had driven in and turned the floor to mud. He
thus describes his night’s lodging:&mdash;“The house and the furniture
are not always nicely suited. We were driven once, by missing
a passage, to the hut of a gentleman where, after a very liberal
supper, when I was conducted to my chamber, I found an elegant
bed of Indian cotton, spread with fine sheets. The accommodation
was flattering; I undressed myself, and felt my feet in the
mire. The bed stood upon the bare earth which a long course
of rain had softened to a puddle.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">INCHKENNETH.</div>

<p>Our travellers having stayed but one night at Ulva, on the
morning of Sunday, October 17, took boat and rowed to Inchkenneth,
“an island about a mile long, and perhaps half a mile broad,
remarkable for pleasantness and fertility. It is verdant and grassy,
and fit both for pasture and tillage; but it has no trees.” The only
inhabitants were “the chief of the ancient and numerous clan of Macleane,
his daughter and their servants.” <span class="sidenote">SIR ALLAN MACLEANE.</span> In a letter to Mrs. Thrale
Johnson says: “Sir Allan, a chieftain, a baronet, and a soldier, inhabits
in this insulated desert a thatched hut with no chambers.
He received us with the soldier’s frankness and the gentleman’s
elegance, and introduced us to his daughters, two young ladies who
have not wanted education suitable to their birth, and who in their
cottage neither forgot their dignity nor affected to remember it.
His affairs are in disorder by the fault of his ancestors, and while
he forms some scheme for retrieving them, he has retreated
hither.” By <em>chambers</em>, Johnson seems to mean rooms on an upper
floor. Boswell describes the habitation as commodious, “though it
consisted but of a few small buildings only one story high.” In two
of these huts were the servants’ rooms and the kitchen. “The
dinner was plentiful and delicate. Neither the comforts nor the
elegancies of life were wanting. There were several dishes and
variety of liquors.” Sir Walter Scott many years later visited the
island in company with a Gloucestershire baronet, Sir George
Onesiphorus Paul:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He seemed to me,” writes Sir Walter, “to suspect many of the Highland tales
which he heard, but he showed most incredulity on the subject of Johnson’s having
been entertained in the wretched huts of which we saw the ruins. He took me aside,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_222" id="Page_222">{222}</a></span>
and conjured me to tell him the truth of the matter. ‘This Sir Allan,’ said he, ‘was
he a <em>regular baronet</em>, or was his title such a traditional one as you find in Ireland?’
I assured my excellent acquaintance that, ‘for my own part, I would have paid more
respect to a knight of Kerry, or knight of Glynn; yet Sir Allan Macleane was a
<em>regular baronet</em> by patent;’ and, having given him this information, I took the liberty
of asking him, in return, whether he would not in conscience prefer the worst cell in
the jail at Gloucester (which he had been very active in overlooking while the building
was going on) to those exposed hovels where Johnson had been entertained by
rank and beauty. He looked round the little islet, and allowed Sir Allan had some
advantage in exercising ground; but in other respects he thought the compulsory
tenants of Gloucester had greatly the advantage. Such was his opinion of a place,
concerning which Johnson has recorded that ‘it wanted little which palaces could
afford.’”</p></div>

<p>Johnson, by the way, did not write “<em>it</em> wanted,” but “<em>we</em> wanted
little that palaces afford.” We have from Sir Walter also an
amusing story which shows how the chief of the Macleanes in the
embarrassment of his affairs had learnt to hate the sight of an
attorney&mdash;<em>writers</em>, as they are called in Scotland:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Upon one occasion he made a visit to a friend residing at Carron lodge, on
the banks of the Carron, where the banks of that river are studded with pretty villas:
Sir Allan, admiring the landscape, asked his friend whom that handsome seat
belonged to. ‘M&mdash;&mdash;, the writer to the signet,’ was the reply. ‘Umph!’ said Sir
Allan, but not with an accent of assent, ‘I mean that other house.’ ‘Oh! that
belongs to a very honest fellow, Jamie &mdash;&mdash;, also a writer to the signet.’ ‘Umph!’
said the Highland chief of Macleane, with more emphasis than before, ‘And yon
smaller house?’ ‘That belongs to a Stirling man; I forget his name, but I am sure
he is a writer too; for &mdash;&mdash;.’ Sir Allan, who had recoiled a quarter of a circle backward
at every response, now wheeled the circle entire, and turned his back on the
landscape, saying, ‘My good friend, I must own you have a pretty situation here;
but d&mdash;n your neighbourhood.’”<a name="FNanchor_676_677" id="FNanchor_676_677"></a><a href="#Footnote_676_677" class="fnanchor">[676]</a></p></div>

<p>In his dislike of lawyers he would have found a common feeling
in Johnson, who one day, “when inquiry was made concerning a
person who had quitted a company where he was, observed that he
did not care to speak ill of any man behind his back, but he believed
the gentleman was an attorney.” Happily there was nothing to disturb
the tranquillity of the scene during the visit of our travellers. <span class="sidenote">A SUNDAY ON INCHKENNETH.</span> The Sunday which Johnson spent on Inchkenneth was, as he told
Boswell, “the most agreeable he had ever passed.” He thus describes
it to Mrs. Thrale: “Towards evening Sir Allan told us
that Sunday never passed over him like another day. One of the
ladies read, and read very well, the evening service, ‘and Paradise
was opened in the wild.’”<a name="FNanchor_677_678" id="FNanchor_677_678"></a><a href="#Footnote_677_678" class="fnanchor">[677]</a> Such was the impression produced on
him that he commemorated the day in some pretty Latin lines<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_223" id="Page_223">{223}</a></span>
entitled, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Insula Sancti Kennethi</i>. Though he would not attend a
Scotch church and hear Robertson preach, yet a woman’s reading
the English service did not shock him.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INCHKENNETH CHAPEL.</p></div>
</div>

<p>Sir Allan had chosen well his hermitage. The landing-place is
on the south-eastern side of the island, in a little bay with a sandy
beach, sheltered by a low point from the storms coming from the
north-west, while the cold blasts from the north and the north-east
are kept off by a low hill. The ground slopes up from the shore
in pleasant meadow land. At the bottom of the slope, a little
above the beach, Sir Allan, I conjecture, had his habitation. Here
are the ruins of a farmhouse which was burnt down a few years
ago. It is very likely that it occupied the same site as his cottages. <span class="sidenote">THE CHAPEL ON INCHKENNETH.</span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_224" id="Page_224">{224}</a></span> The road marked with cart-wheels, as on the main land, at the
sight of which Dr. Johnson’s heart was cheered, I failed to discover.
We wandered up the little path to where on the rising
ground the ruined chapel stands within the hearing of the wave.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We walked uncovered into the chapel,” writes Johnson, “and saw in the
reverend ruin the effects of precipitate reformation. The floor is covered with
ancient grave-stones, of which the inscriptions are not now legible. The altar is
not yet quite demolished; beside it, on the right side, is a <em>bas relief</em> of the Virgin
with her child, and an angel hovering over her. On the other side still stands a
hand-bell, which, though it has no clapper, neither Presbyterian bigotry nor barbarian
wantonness has yet taken away. The chapel is thirty-eight feet long and
eighteen broad. Boswell, who is very pious, went into it at night to perform his
devotions, but came back in haste for fear of spectres. Near the chapel is a fountain,
to which the water, remarkably pure, is conveyed from a distant hill through
pipes laid by the Romish clergy, which still perform the office of conveyance though
they have never been repaired since Popery was suppressed.”</p></div>

<p>Our boatman, whom I had in vain questioned about Johnson’s
host, led me up to the tomb of an old knight, clothed in armour,
with a dog lying at his feet, and said, “That is Sir Allan.” The
little fountain, in spite of the lapse of years and the long drought,
still ran with a stream of pure water. Besides the chapel, there
had once been on the island a seminary of priests. “Sir Allan,”
writes Johnson, “had a mind to trace the foundations of a college,
but neither I nor Mr. Boswell, who bends a keener eye on vacancy,
were able to perceive them.” Where they failed we could not hope
to succeed. We next explored, as they had done, a neighbouring
islet.</p>

<div class="sidenote">SANDILAND.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Even Inchkenneth,” says Johnson, “has a subordinate island, named Sandiland,
I suppose in contempt, where we landed, and found a rock, with a surface of
perhaps four acres, of which one is naked stone, another spread with sand and
shells, some of which I picked up for their glossy beauty, and two covered with a
little earth and grass, on which Sir Allan has a few sheep. I doubt not but when
there was a college at Inchkenneth, there was a hermitage upon Sandiland.”</p></div>

<div class="figcenter w600"><a id="facing_page_224"></a>
<img src="images/illus_112.jpg" width="600" height="294" alt="" />
<div class="caption"><p>SANDILAND.</p></div>
</div>

<p>The shells, perhaps, he kept to add to the collection of Mrs. Thrale’s
eldest daughter. “I have been able,” he wrote later on, “to collect
very little for Queeney’s cabinet.” The name which our boatman
gave to the island was, so far as I could catch it, not Sandiland,
but Sameilan. At the time of our visit it had for inhabitants four
sheep, and flocks of sea-birds who made it their breeding ground.
They flew circling and screaming over our heads, while a mother
bird led off a late brood of little ones into the sea. Before each of
the burrows in which they made their nests was a litter of tiny<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_225" id="Page_225">{225}</a></span>
shells thrown up like sand before a rabbit-warren. The sun shone
brightly, the little waves beat on the shore, while all around us
there were mountains, islands, and lochs. As I picked up a few
shells, I thought that on this lonely rock, perhaps, none had been
gathered since the day when they caught Johnson’s eye by
their glossy beauty. In sailing back to the mainland of Mull
we saw four seals popping up their heads in the water near the
shore.</p>

<div class="figcenter w400">

<div class="caption"><p>MACKINNON’S CAVE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>So pleasant did Johnson find the life in Inchkenneth that he
remained a day longer than he had intended. “We could have
been easily persuaded,” he writes, “to a longer stay, but life will
not be all passed in delight. The session at Edinburgh was<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_226" id="Page_226">{226}</a></span>
approaching from which Mr. Boswell could not be absent.” On
the morning of Tuesday, October 19, they started for Iona in a
good strong boat, with four stout rowers under the guidance of the
chief of the Macleanes. On the shore they took their last farewell
of poor Col, “who,” wrote Johnson, “had treated us with so much
kindness, and concluded his favours by consigning us to Sir
Allan.” <span class="sidenote">MACKINNON’S CAVE.</span> On the way they visited Mackinnon’s Cave, on the
opposite coast of Mull, “the greatest natural curiosity,” said
Johnson, “he had ever seen.” He thus describes it in a letter to
Mrs. Thrale.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had some difficulty to make our way over the vast masses of broken rocks
that lie before the entrance, and at the mouth were embarrassed with stones, which
the sea had accumulated as at Brighthelmstone; but as we advanced we reached a
floor of soft sand, and as we left the light behind us walked along a very spacious
cavity vaulted overhead with an arch almost regular, by which a mountain was sustained,
at least, a very lofty rock. From this magnificent cavern went a narrow
passage to the right-hand, which we entered with a candle, and though it was
obstructed with great stones, clambered over them to a second expansion of the
cave, in which there lies a great square stone, which might serve as a table. The
cave goes onward to an unknown extent, but we were now one hundred and sixty
yards under ground; we had but one candle, and had never heard of any that went
further and came back; we therefore thought it prudent to return.”</p></div>

<p>“Tradition,” according to Boswell, “says that a piper and twelve
men once advanced into this cave, nobody can tell how far; and
never returned.” It is indeed a wonderful place. As we sat on
the rocks near the entrance, with the huge cliffs rising sheer above
us, and the waves breaking at our feet, we could see in the distance
Iona, with its beach of white sand, Staffa with its lofty masses of
dark rock, Little Colonsay with the waves dashing in foam upon it,
and on the horizon a coast which we took to be the island of Col.
Vast masses of rock lay along the beach in huge and wild disorder.
Beyond the cavern they came to an end; for there the cliff rose
from the sea steep as the wall of a house. The cascade near the
cave, which Boswell mentions, was falling in a very slender stream.
Hard by a huge crag was covered almost to the top by the fresh
young leaves of a great ivy-tree. It called up to my memory the
ivy-mantled ruins of Kenilworth Castle.</p>

<p>Our travellers, taking boat again, continued their voyage along
the shore of Mull. “The island of Staffa,” writes Boswell, “we
saw at no very great distance, but could not land upon it, the surge
was so high on its rocky coast.” It is strange that Sir James
Mackintosh, with this passage before him, should have accused<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_227" id="Page_227">{227}</a></span>
Johnson of having visited Iona, “without looking at Staffa, which
lay in sight, with that indifference to natural objects, either of taste
or scientific curiosity, which characterised him.”<a name="FNanchor_678_679" id="FNanchor_678_679"></a><a href="#Footnote_678_679" class="fnanchor">[678]</a> As they sailed
along, “Sir Allan, anxious for the honour of Mull, was still talking
of its <em>woods</em>, and pointing them out to Dr. Johnson, as appearing at a
distance on the skirts of that island. ‘Sir,’ he answered, ‘I saw at
Tobermory what they called a wood, which I unluckily took for
<em>heath</em>. If you show me what I shall take for <em>furze</em>, it will be
something.’”</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">ROVING AMONG THE HEBRIDES.</div>

<p>They dined at “a cluster of rocks, black and horrid,” near to
which was a public-house where they had hoped to procure some
rum or brandy for the boatmen; “but unfortunately a funeral a
few days before had
exhausted all their
store.” Smollett in his
<cite>Humphry Clinker</cite>,
tells how a Highland
gentleman, at his
grandmother’s
funeral, “seemed to
think it a disparagement
to his family
that not above a
hundred gallons of
whisky had been
drunk upon such a
solemn occasion.”<a name="FNanchor_679_680" id="FNanchor_679_680"></a><a href="#Footnote_679_680" class="fnanchor">[679]</a> The rest of this day’s voyage Johnson thus
finely described in one of his letters: “We then entered the
boat again; the night came upon us: the wind rose; the sea
swelled. We passed by several little islands in the silent solemnity
of faint moonshine, seeing little, and hearing only the wind and
the water. At last we reached the island; the venerable seat of
ancient sanctity, where secret piety reposed, and where fallen
greatness was reposited.” Boswell adds that as they “sailed along
by moonlight in a sea somewhat rough, and often between black
and gloomy rocks, Dr. Johnson said, ‘If this be not roving among
the Hebrides nothing is.’”</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE MACLEANES OF IONA.</div>

<p>Iona, which of old belonged to the Macleanes, in their recent
embarassments had been sold to the Duke of Argyle. Though<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">{228}</a></span>
the tie of property was broken yet the feeling of clanship remained
entire. “Whatever was in the island,” writes Johnson, “Sir Allan
could demand, for the inhabitants were Macleanes; but having
little they could not give us much.” A curious scene described
by Boswell bears witness to the strength of the devotion of these
poor people.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir Allan had been told that a man had refused to send him some rum, at which
the knight was in great indignation. ‘You rascal! (said he,) don’t you know that I
can hang you, if I please?’ Not adverting to the Chieftain’s power over his clan, I
imagined that Sir Allan had known of some capital crime that the fellow had committed,
which he could discover, and so get him condemned; and said, ‘How so?’
‘Why, (said Sir Allan,) are they not all my people?’ Sensible of my inadvertency,
and most willing to contribute what I could towards the continuation of feudal
authority, ‘Very true,’ said I. Sir Allan went on: ‘Refuse to send rum to me, you
rascal! Don’t you know that, if I order you to go and cut a man’s throat, you are
to do it?’ ‘Yes, an’t please your honour! and my own too, and hang myself too.’
The poor fellow denied that he had refused to send the rum. His making these
professions was not merely a pretence in presence of his Chief; for after he and I
were out of Sir Allan’s hearing, he told me, ‘Had he sent his dog for the rum, I
would have given it: I would cut my bones for him.’ It was very remarkable to
find such an attachment to a Chief, though he had then no connection with the
island, and had not been there for fourteen years. Sir Allan, by way of upbraiding
the fellow, said, ‘I believe you are a <em>Campbell</em>.’”</p></div>

<p>The memory of the power so lately exercised throughout the
Highlands by the chiefs was not soon forgotten. It was noticed
so late as 1793, that in Scotland <em>master</em> was still, for the most part,
the term used for <em>landlord</em>. As an instance of this it was mentioned
that in a sermon preached in the High Church of Edinburgh in
1788, the minister thus described the late Earl of Kinnoul in relation
to his tenants.<a name="FNanchor_680_681" id="FNanchor_680_681"></a><a href="#Footnote_680_681" class="fnanchor">[680]</a> Even after the abolition of the jurisdictions
of the chiefs the powers left in the hands of the justices were very
great. “An inferior judge in Scotland,” wrote the historian of
Edinburgh in the year 1779, “makes nothing of sentencing a man
to whipping, pillory, banishment from the limits of his jurisdiction,
and such other trifling punishments, without the idle formality of a
jury.”<a name="FNanchor_681_682" id="FNanchor_681_682"></a><a href="#Footnote_681_682" class="fnanchor">[681]</a></p>

<p>In Iona, however, there was no need of threats. The poor
people were devoted to their former chief. “He went,” says
Johnson, “to the headman of the island whom fame, but fame
delights in amplifying, represents as worth no less than fifty pounds.
He was, perhaps, proud enough of his guests, but ill prepared for<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">{229}</a></span>
our entertainment; however, he soon produced more provision than
men not luxurious required.” There was not a single house in
which, with any comfort, they could have been lodged. Pennant,
who had been there a year earlier, “had pitched a rude tent formed
of oars and sails.” There was but one house which had a chimney.
“Nevertheless, even in this,” says Johnson, “the fire was made on
the floor in the middle of the room, and notwithstanding the
dignity of their mansion the inmates rejoiced like their neighbours
in the comforts of smoke.” Though the soil was naturally fruitful,
yet the poverty of the people was great. “They are,” he adds,
“remarkably gross and remarkably neglected; I know not if they
are visited by any minister. The island, which was once the
metropolis of learning and piety, has now no school for education
nor temple for worship, only two inhabitants that can speak
English, and not one that can write or read.” The population was
probably not less than four hundred souls.<a name="FNanchor_682_683" id="FNanchor_682_683"></a><a href="#Footnote_682_683" class="fnanchor">[682]</a> Sacheverell, who was
there in 1688, mentions a class of “hereditary servants. They are,”
he adds, “miserably poor. They seem an innocent, simple people,
ignorant and devout; and though they have no minister, they
constantly assemble in the great church on Sundays, where they
spend most part of the day in private devotions.”<a name="FNanchor_683_684" id="FNanchor_683_684"></a><a href="#Footnote_683_684" class="fnanchor">[683]</a> According to
Pennant they were “the most stupid and the most lazy of all the
islanders.” “They used,” he says, “the Chapel of the Nunnery as
a cow-shed; the floor was covered some feet thick with dung, for
they were too lazy to remove this fine manure, the collection of a
century, to enrich their grounds.”<a name="FNanchor_684_685" id="FNanchor_684_685"></a><a href="#Footnote_684_685" class="fnanchor">[684]</a> Boswell, however, gives a
much better report. “They are industrious,” he says, “and make
their own woollen and linen cloth; and they brew a good deal of
beer, which we did not find in any of the other islands.” In July,
1798, Dr. Garnett and his companion, Mr. Watts, the painter,
passed a night in the public-house. The floor of their chamber
was liquid mud; the rain fell on their beds. For fellow-lodgers
they had several chickens, a tame lamb, a dog, some cats, and two
or three pigs. Next morning they invited the schoolmaster to

With such houses and such people Sir Allan Macleane certainly
did wisely in choosing a barn for the lodgings of himself and his two
friends. “Some good hay,” writes Boswell, “was strewed at one
end of it, to form a bed for us, upon which we lay with our clothes
on; and we were furnished with blankets from the village. Each
of us had a portmanteau for a pillow. When I awaked in the
morning, and looked round me, I could not help smiling at the
idea of the chief of the Macleanes, the great English Moralist,
and myself, lying thus extended in such a situation.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">IONA’S PAST AND PRESENT.</div>

<p>The smile might have passed into a sigh, had Boswell contrasted
the splendours of Iona’s past with the meanness of her present lot.
They had come to</p>

<p>Whether with Johnson among “those illustrious ruins,” we
look upon Iona as the instructress of the west, or with Gibbon as
the island whence was “diffused over the northern regions a doubtful
ray of science and superstition,” in either case it is surely
a spot where we are forced to pause, and with pensive mind
“revolve the sad vicissitude of things.” I must not, however, be
unjust to Boswell. It was his enthusiasm which had led them
hither. It was he who had longed to survey Iona. “I,” said
Johnson, “though less eager did not oppose him.” To him then
we owe that splendid passage in which the great Englishman
celebrates the power exerted over the mind by the sight of places
where noble deeds were done, and noble lives were lived.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We were now treading that illustrious Island, which was once the luminary of
the Caledonian regions, whence savage clans and roving barbarians derived the
benefits of knowledge, and the blessings of religion. To abstract the mind from all
local emotion would be impossible, if it were endeavoured, and would be foolish if
it were possible. Whatever withdraws us from the power of our senses, whatever
makes the past, the distant, or the future, predominate over the present, advances us
in the dignity of thinking beings. Far from me, and from my friends, be such frigid<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_231" id="Page_231">{231}</a></span>
philosophy as may conduct us indifferent and unmoved over any ground which has
been dignified by wisdom, bravery, or virtue. That man is little to be envied,
whose patriotism would not gain force upon the plain of Marathon, or whose piety
would not grow warmer among the ruins of Iona!”</p></div>

<p>Boswell surely not without good reason maintains that “had
their tour produced nothing else but this sublime passage the
world must have acknowledged that it was not made in vain.”</p>

(October 20-22).</span></a></h2>

<p>Sailing from Iona about midday on Wednesday, October 20,
our travellers landed in the evening on the southern coast of Mull,
near the house of the Rev. Neal Macleod, who gave them lodgings
for the night. Johnson oddly described him as “the cleanest-headed
man that he had met with in the Western Islands.” The
talk ran on English statesmen. Here it was that Johnson called
Mr. Pitt a meteor, and Sir Robert Walpole a fixed star, and maintained<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">{232}</a></span>
that Pulteney was as paltry a fellow as could be. Continuing
their journey on the morrow, they dined at the house of a physician,
“who was so much struck with the uncommon conversation of
Johnson, that he observed to Boswell, ‘This man is just a hogshead
of sense.’” This doctor’s practice could scarcely have been
very lucrative, for there came a time when he had no successor.
Garnett writing of Mull at the end of the century, says, “There is
at present no medical man in the island; the nearest surgeon of
eminence is at Inverary.”<a name="FNanchor_687_688" id="FNanchor_687_688"></a><a href="#Footnote_687_688" class="fnanchor">[687]</a> The distance from that town to the
farthest points in Mull, as the crow flies, is not less than sixty miles,
but by the route taken would be perhaps one hundred. <span class="sidenote">GLOOM AND DESOLATION.</span> In the
afternoon our travellers rode, writes Boswell, “through what
appeared to me the most gloomy and desolate country I had ever
beheld.” “It was,” said Johnson, “a country of such gloomy
desolation that Mr. Boswell thought no part of the Highlands
equally terrific.” Faujas Saint-Fond, a few years later, describes
Mull as a country “without a single road, without a single tree,
where the mountains have heather for their only covering.”<a name="FNanchor_688_689" id="FNanchor_688_689"></a><a href="#Footnote_688_689" class="fnanchor">[688]</a>
Amidst the beautiful plantations and the fine trees with which this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">{233}</a></span>
island is now in so many parts adorned, the modern tourist fails to
recognize the truthfulness of these gloomy descriptions. Our
travellers were to spend the night at Moy, the seat of the Laird of
Lochbuy,<a name="FNanchor_689_690" id="FNanchor_689_690"></a><a href="#Footnote_689_690" class="fnanchor">[689]</a> at the head of the fine loch from which he takes his title. <span class="sidenote">THE APPROACH TO LOCHBUY.</span> I approached it from the north-eastern side of the island, having
driven over from Craignure, a little port in the Sound of Mull.
Perhaps the country through which I passed was naturally finer
than that which they had traversed in coming from the south-west.
Perhaps, on the other hand, the difference was chiefly due to the
trees and to better weather. Certainly the long drive, though in
places dreary, was for a great part of the road on a bright, windy
summer day, one of remarkable beauty. I passed lochs of the sea
with the waves tossing, the sea-fowl hovering and settling and
screaming, great herons standing on the shore, and the sea-trout
leaping in the waters. But far more beautiful was Loch Uisk, an
inland lake embosomed among the mountains, its steep shores covered
with trees. The strong wind was driving the scud like dust over the
face of its dark waters. As I drew near Lochbuy, I caught
sight of the ivy-mantled tower across a meadow, where the mowers
were cutting the grass, and the hay-makers were tossing it out to
the sun and wind. Beyond the castle there was a broad stretch of
white sand; a small vessel lay at anchor, ready at the next tide to
run ashore and discharge the hamlet’s winter stock of coal. Tall
trunks of fir-trees were lying near the water’s edge ready for
shipping. At the head of the loch are two beautiful bays, each
with its pastures and tilled lands, its low-wooded heights and its
lofty circling mountains, each facing the south-west and sheltered
from the cold winds. Between these two bays rise fine crags,
hidden in places beneath hazels and ivy. For most of the year it
is a land streaming with waterfalls. In beautiful ravines, half
hidden by the trees, wild cascades rush down, swollen by the storms
that have burst on the mountains; but at the time of my visit their
voice was hushed by the long drought. So dry had the springs
become in some places, that I was told at Lochbuy that to one of
the neighbouring islands water had to be carried in boats.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE LAIRD OF LOCHBUY.</div>

<p>Close to the ruined Castle stood “the mansion, not very
spacious or splendid,” where Macleane of Lochbuy, “a true Highland
laird, rough and haughty, and tenacious of his dignity,”
entertained our travellers.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">{234}</a></span></p>
<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We had heard much,” writes Boswell, “of Lochbuy’s being a great roaring
braggadocio, a kind of Sir John Falstaff, both in size and manners; but we found
that they had swelled him up to a fictitious size, and clothed him with imaginary
qualities. Col’s idea of him was equally extravagant, though very different: he told
us he was quite a Don Quixote; and said, he would give a great deal to see him
and Dr. Johnson together. The truth is, that Lochbuy proved to be only a bluff,
comely, noisy, old gentleman, proud of his hereditary consequence, and a very
hearty and hospitable landlord. Lady Lochbuy was sister to Sir Allan Macleane,
but much older. He said to me, ‘They are quite <em>Antediluvians</em>.’ Being told that
Dr. Johnson did not hear well, Lochbuy bawled out to him, ‘Are you of the
Johnstons of Glencro, or of Ardnamurchan?’ Dr. Johnson gave him a significant
look, but made no answer; and I told Lochbuy that he was not Johns<em>ton</em>, but
John<em>son</em>, and that he was an Englishman.”<a name="FNanchor_690_691" id="FNanchor_690_691"></a><a href="#Footnote_690_691" class="fnanchor">[690]</a></p></div>

<p>According to Sir Walter Scott, Boswell misapprehended Lochbuy’s
meaning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There are,” he says, “two septs of the powerful clan of M’Donald, who are
called Mac-Ian, that is <em>John’s-son</em>; and as Highlanders often translate their names
when they go to the Lowlands,&mdash;as Gregor-son for Mac-Gregor, Farquhar-son for
Mac-Farquhar,&mdash;Lochbuy supposed that Dr. Johnson might be one of the Mac-Ians
of Ardnamurchan, or of Glencro. Boswell’s explanation was nothing to the purpose.
The <em>Johnstons</em> are a clan distinguished in Scottish border history, and as brave as
any Highland clan that ever wore brogues; but they lay entirely out of Lochbuy’s
knowledge&mdash;nor was he thinking of them.”</p></div>

<p>I have little doubt, however, that whatever Lochbuy was
thinking of he pronounced the name <em>Johnston</em>. In this both
Boswell and Johnson agree. This too was the name which I
commonly found given to the great man in the Highlands and
Lowlands alike.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The following day (writes Boswell) we surveyed the old castle, in the pit or
dungeon of which Lochbuy had some years before taken upon him to imprison
several persons; and though he had been fined in a considerable sum by the Court
of Justiciary, he was so little affected by it, that while we were examining the
dungeon, he said to me, with a smile, ‘Your father knows something of this;’
(alluding to my father’s having sat as one of the judges on his trial). Sir Allan
whispered me, that the laird could not be persuaded that he had lost his heritable
jurisdiction.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">HEREDITARY JURISDICTIONS.</div>

<p>Up to the year 1747 “in the Highlands,” to quote Johnson’s
words, “some great lords had an hereditary jurisdiction over
counties, and some chieftains over their own lands.” This subjection
of the people to their chiefs was rightly regarded as one of the main
sources of the rebellions of 1715 and 1745. He who by law was
privileged to keep a pit, a dungeon, and a gallows, was not likely
to meet with much resistance when he summoned his people to
follow him to the field. Advantage was therefore taken of the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_235" id="Page_235">{235}</a></span>
defeat of the clansmen at Culloden, “to crush all the Local Courts
and to extend the general benefits of equal law to the low and the
high, in the deepest recesses and obscurest corners.” The heritable
jurisdiction had been divided into regalities, ordinary baronies, and
baronies which had the right of pit and gallows.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The lowest criminal jurisdiction,” says a Scotch legal author, “is what we call
for Battery and Bloodwits, <em>viz.</em>, Offences whereby a party is beaten, or blood drawn
of him, but no greater harm done; and this is implied in all Baronies. But if the
erection of the Barony contain a power of Pit and Gallows, it imports a jurisdiction
in ordinary capital cases, but not in the excepted crimes, which go under the name
of the <em>Four Pleas of the Crown</em>, <em>viz.</em>, Murder, Robbery, Rape, and wilful Fire-raising.
It is so called from the manner of execution of criminals, <em>viz.</em>, by hanging
the men upon the Gallows or Gibbet, and drowning the women, sentenced in a
capital crime, in a pit, it not being thought decent of old to hang them.”<a name="FNanchor_691_692" id="FNanchor_691_692"></a><a href="#Footnote_691_692" class="fnanchor">[691]</a></p></div>

<p>In old law Latin this right was known under the name of
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furca et fossa</i>.<a name="FNanchor_692_693" id="FNanchor_692_693"></a><a href="#Footnote_692_693" class="fnanchor">[692]</a> A person invested with the jurisdiction of a
regality had power also in the Four Pleas of the Crown. “The
sentences in civil cases are subject to the review of the Lords of
Session, and in criminal to the Court of Justiciary. In criminal
trials thirty days were allowed before execution of the sentence on
this [the southern] side of the Forth, and forty on the other.”
From this appeal there was one regality which was exempt. The
jurisdiction of the Duke of Argyle was absolute even in cases of
life and death. From his sentences there was no appeal.<a name="FNanchor_693_694" id="FNanchor_693_694"></a><a href="#Footnote_693_694" class="fnanchor">[693]</a> Each
barony had its Gallows Hill, and its dempster or hangman.<a name="FNanchor_694_695" id="FNanchor_694_695"></a><a href="#Footnote_694_695" class="fnanchor">[694]</a>
Pennant, in 1772, saw “on a little flat hill near the village of
Kilarow in Islay the remains of the gallows.”<a name="FNanchor_695_696" id="FNanchor_695_696"></a><a href="#Footnote_695_696" class="fnanchor">[695]</a> At Dunvegan men
had been hanged on the sentence of the laird, so late as 1740.
No doubt this power was sometimes most oppressively exercised.
A chief who lived near Inverness was charged with having rid
himself at a profit of men on his estate who had given him trouble.
He charged them with theft, threatened them with the gallows,
and so brought them “to sign a contract for their banishment.”
They were then put on board a ship bound to the West Indies,
“the master paying so much a head for them.”<a name="FNanchor_696_697" id="FNanchor_696_697"></a><a href="#Footnote_696_697" class="fnanchor">[696]</a> In other words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_236" id="Page_236">{236}</a></span>
they were sold for slaves, if not for life, at all events for a certain
number of years.</p>

<p>No change had been made by the Act of Union of 1706, for it
was expressly provided in it that all these heritable jurisdictions
“should be reserved to the owners as rights and property.”<a name="FNanchor_697_698" id="FNanchor_697_698"></a><a href="#Footnote_697_698" class="fnanchor">[697]</a> When
in 1747 these powers had been swept away, two unhappy classes of
men were excepted from the full benefit of the Act. The workers in
any kind of mine or in salt-works were to remain as they had
hitherto been&mdash;serfs for life. These men were found only in the
Lowlands, chiefly in the neighbourhood of Edinburgh. Nevertheless,
even they were not left altogether without relief. “All
jurisdiction in any case inferring the loss of life or demembration,
was abrogated.”<a name="FNanchor_698_699" id="FNanchor_698_699"></a><a href="#Footnote_698_699" class="fnanchor">[698]</a> A collier or a salter therefore could no longer
be hanged or drowned, or even mangled by his master. It was
not till the last year of the century that they were finally and
fully freed. One of these emancipated serfs lived till the year
1844.<a name="FNanchor_699_700" id="FNanchor_699_700"></a><a href="#Footnote_699_700" class="fnanchor">[699]</a></p>

<p>The Act of 1747 not only abolished jurisdictions, but also
alleviated the prisoner’s lot. Till it was passed, “all over Scotland
pits were accounted legal prisons for thieves and other meaner
criminals.”<a name="FNanchor_700_701" id="FNanchor_700_701"></a><a href="#Footnote_700_701" class="fnanchor">[700]</a> Lady Margaret Bellenden in <cite>Old Mortality</cite> praises
her pit. “It is not more than two stories beneath ground,” she
says, “so it cannot be unwholesome, especially as I rather believe
there is somewhere an opening to the outer air.”<a name="FNanchor_701_702" id="FNanchor_701_702"></a><a href="#Footnote_701_702" class="fnanchor">[701]</a> But henceforth&mdash;so
the Act ran&mdash;“the prison shall have such windows or grates,
as that it may be practicable for any friend of the prisoner to visit,
see, and converse with him when he shall be so minded.”<a name="FNanchor_702_703" id="FNanchor_702_703"></a><a href="#Footnote_702_703" class="fnanchor">[702]</a> In out
of the way places, where there were no justices within reach, the
laird, no doubt, to some extent, continued to exercise his old
powers. Thus in Col, more than sixteen years after the Act was
passed, the laird put a woman into “the family prison” for theft.<a name="FNanchor_703_704" id="FNanchor_703_704"></a><a href="#Footnote_703_704" class="fnanchor">[703]</a>
There have been men who regarded, or affected to regard with
indignation the abolition of these injurious hereditary powers.
“By the nation at large,” writes Dr. Robert Chambers, “the
measure was contemplated as a last stab to the independence of
Scotland, previously almost destroyed by the Union.”<a name="FNanchor_704_705" id="FNanchor_704_705"></a><a href="#Footnote_704_705" class="fnanchor">[704]</a> There is<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_237" id="Page_237">{237}</a></span>
happily no reason to believe that the nation at large was at any
period of its history a set of sentimental fools.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LOCHBUY BEFORE THE COURT.</div>

<p>To most of the chiefs this loss of their ancient jurisdictions
must have come as a terrible shock. Lochbuy, as has been seen,
had refused to believe it, and so had got into trouble with the
Court of Justiciary. After some search I was fortunate enough to
discover a report of his case. He had, as I was informed by his
descendant, the present laird, with the help of his piper let down a
man into the pit. But here, for once, tradition has not been guilty
of amplification. Aided by his servant, his piper and son, the innkeeper
in Moy, and two other tenants, he had seized two men of
the name of Maclean, and had imprisoned them two days “in an
old ruinous castle.” Two of the accused did not appear to the
indictment, “they were therefore fugitated (outlawed), and their
moveables escheated to the king for their contempt.” The trial
took place on August 15, 1759. It lasted twelve hours. “The
jury (of which a majority was landed gentlemen) returned their
verdict unanimously, finding the pannels (prisoners at the bar)
guilty; but verbally recommending the four servants and tenants
to the mercy of the court, it appearing that what they did was by
order of Lochbuy, their master. The lords pronounced sentence,
decerning Lochbuy in £180 sterling of expenses and damages to
the private prosecutors, and 500 marks Scots (about £27) of
fine; and condemning the whole pannels to seventeen days’ imprisonment.”<a name="FNanchor_705_706" id="FNanchor_705_706"></a><a href="#Footnote_705_706" class="fnanchor">[705]</a></p>

<p>Lochbuy had no doubt been the more unwilling to believe in the
abolition of his jurisdiction as he had, it should seem, no share in
that “valuable consideration in money which was granted to every
nobleman and petty baron who was thus deprived of one part of
his inheritance.”<a name="FNanchor_706_707" id="FNanchor_706_707"></a><a href="#Footnote_706_707" class="fnanchor">[706]</a> On what principle of justice this compensation
was given is not clear, unless we agree with Johnson in his assertion
that “those who have long enjoyed dignity and power ought
not to lose it without some equivalent.”<a name="FNanchor_707_708" id="FNanchor_707_708"></a><a href="#Footnote_707_708" class="fnanchor">[707]</a> Professor Thorold
Rogers informs me that we have here, he believes, the first
instance in our history where compensation is paid by the country
at large for the vested interests of a class. The claims which were
made were excessive, partly no doubt in the hope that when much
was demanded at all events something would be given, but partly,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_238" id="Page_238">{238}</a></span>
it was said, with the intention of “obstructing the Act, and raising
discontents in the country.”<a name="FNanchor_708_709" id="FNanchor_708_709"></a><a href="#Footnote_708_709" class="fnanchor">[708]</a> The total sum asked for was
£587,000, but only £152,000 was granted. Among the claimants
I found “Maclean of Lochbuie, Bailie of the Bailiery of Morovis
and Mulerois, £500.” His name does not appear among the list
of those whose claims were allowed.<a name="FNanchor_709_710" id="FNanchor_709_710"></a><a href="#Footnote_709_710" class="fnanchor">[709]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LOCHBUY CASTLE.</div>

<p>Though in 1759 the castle was described as ruinous, nevertheless
it had been inhabited by the laird a few years earlier. Over
the entrance of the house in which he received Johnson is inscribed:
“Hæc domus [a word effaced] erat per Johannem M’Laine
De Lochbuy Anno Dom. 1752.” It has, in its turn, given way to
a more modern mansion, and has been converted into stables,
coach-houses, and hay-lofts. The castle was built on the edge of
the sea, “four-square to all the winds that blew.” The walls, nine
or ten feet thick, “are probably as old as the fourteenth century, but
the upper part seems to have been modified in the seventeenth.”<a name="FNanchor_710_711" id="FNanchor_710_711"></a><a href="#Footnote_710_711" class="fnanchor">[710]</a>
The ivy has climbed up to the top, nevertheless much of the stonework
is still seen. It would be a pity if it were suffered to cover
the walls on all sides. Hard by a little stream shaded with trees
makes its way into the loch. To the north-west rises the steep
hill of Dun Buy. “<i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">Buy</i> in Erse,” says Boswell, “signifies yellow.
The hill being of a yellowish hue, has the epithet of <i lang="gd" xml:lang="gd">buy</i>.” This
hue I altogether failed to discover; perhaps it is only seen in the
autumn. On the bright summer’s day in which I saw the castle, it
seemed to be almost unsurpassed in the pleasantness of its seat.
Tall trees grew near it, their leaves rustling in the wind, and the
lights and shadows dancing on the ground as the branches swayed
to and fro, while in front lay the loch with its foaming waves. The
old ruin looked as if it had been set there to add to the beauty of
the scene, not for a place where lairds and their pipers should let
down luckless folk into dismal pits. In the inside there was gloom
enough. A few well-worn stone steps lead up to the entrance.
The strong old door studded with iron nails which had withstood
the storms of many a long year, has at length yielded to time, and
been replaced. Behind it is an iron grate secured by bolts and by
an oaken bar that is drawn forth from a hole in the wall. Passing
on I went into a gloomy vault known as the store-room. Not a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">{239}</a></span>
ray of light entered save by the open door. In the rocky floor
there is a shallow well, which in the driest seasons is always full
of water. The arched roof is built of huge boulders gathered from
the beach, the spaces between being filled up with thin layers of
stone after the fashion of Roman masonry. A dark staircase in
the thickness of the wall leads up through another strong door to a
second vaulted chamber, dimly lighted by narrow slits at the end
of two slanting recesses, on each side of which are stone benches.
This I was told was the court-room or judgment-hall. Opening
out of it on one side is a very small chamber, in which was a kind
of cupboard, a hiding-place perhaps for title-deeds and plate, for it
could be so closed with stones as to look like solid wall. On the
other side is the door to the dungeon, dismal enough, but not so
dismal as the pit below, with its well in which women could be
put to death with decency. On either side of the mouth of the
well is a narrow ledge some eighteen inches wide, but not long
enough to allow the prisoner to stretch himself at full length. On
the floor above the court-room was the kitchen, with walls more
than seven feet thick. It occupied the whole of the story. On
the freestone joints of the great hearth can be seen the deep
marks made by sharpening knives. Above the kitchen was the
family sitting-room, which was entered from a gallery running all
round it outside, and built in the overhanging part of the tower.
Here at length I arrived at what may be called the front door.
There was some attempt at ornament in the carving on the stones
at the top and each side of the doorway. There was, moreover,
light enough to see it clearly, for the gallery can boast of fair-sized
windows. From one of them the laird could look out on the
Hangman’s Hill, about a third of a mile off, now covered with fir-trees,
but then bare. Some stones remain, in which the gallows
were set up. The view from the castle, except when a hanging
was going on, must on a fine day have been always beautiful, even
when the country was bare of trees. To the north and east they
looked over fields, once yellow every autumn with grain, but now
pleasant meadow-land, shut in with hills and mountains down
whose sides in rainy weather rivers stream and cascades leap.
From one corner of the gallery a turret projects with two narrow
windows, where the watchman could see anyone approaching from
the side of the land. Not far from it was “the whispering hole,”
where, by removing a stone which exactly fits into an opening, a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">{240}</a></span>
suspicious laird could overhear the talk in the kitchen beneath.
Above the sitting-room was another story divided into small rooms,
the bed-chamber of the family. So solidly had the roof been built,
that unrepaired it withstood all the blasts of heaven, till that
terrible storm burst upon it and brought it down, which swept
away the Tay Bridge.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE OLD LAIRD AND THE NEW.</div>

<p>In these two upper stories there were, no doubt, cheerful rooms,
but they were reached through gloomy doors and iron grates, up
dark staircases, with rough sides and well-worn steps, past the
gloomy dungeon. Everything shows signs of danger and alarm.
“It was sufficient for a Laird of the Hebrides,” as Johnson says,
“if he had a strong house in which he could hide his wife and
children from the next clan.” At the present day, as I was told
by my guide, no one thinks of locking his door at night-time. My
bag and great-coat and travelling rug were left in perfect safety
for a couple of hours by the road-side while I wandered about. Of
the modern mansion Johnson would never have said what he said
of the second house, that “it was built with little regard to convenience,
and with none to elegance or pleasure.” He would have
been delighted not only with it, but with its large garden full of
flowers and vegetables and fruits that testify to the mildness of the
climate. The peaches ripen on the walls, though they do not
attain to a large size. The hot-houses were full of choice plants,
and clustering grapes. One bunch, I was told, had weighed
nearly five pounds. But there are far greater changes than those
worked by builders and gardeners. Here, where the rough old
Laird in his out-of-the-way corner of the world used to rule his
people with the help of gallows, pit and dungeon, I found a
money-order office, a savings bank, a telegraph office, and a daily
post. There is a good school, governed by a School Board, and a
large reading room where the dulness of the long winter nights is
relieved by various kinds of entertainments. There is besides an
infirmary under the management of a qualified nurse, the daughter
of a medical man, who has learnt her art by some years’ study in a
hospital. She is provided with a chest of surgical instruments and
a large stock of drugs. On her little pony she sometimes has to
attend sick people at a distance of eight miles. Forty-three cases
of measles had lately been under her care and none of them ended
fatally. There is a salmon-hatching house, and a museum both of
antiquities and natural curiosities. In it I saw a thumbscrew, with an<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">{241}</a></span>
iron ring at one end through which a thong could be passed. Used in
this way it would have served much the same purpose as hand-cuffs.
I looked with interest on an old Highland spinning-wheel, the gift
of my intelligent and friendly guide, Mr. Angus Black. It had
belonged to his grandmother. He had given it, he said, “to be
kept there as a present for ages and generations to come.” When
a little before I drank water from “the well by the river side,”
such was the name of the spring in Gaelic, he told me that it was
the spring “whence the Lairds had drunk for ages and generations
past.” One thing I in vain looked for in the Museum. Boswell
had been told much of a war-saddle, on which Lochbuy, “that
reputed Don Quixote, used to be mounted; but we did not see it,”
he adds, “for the young Laird had applied it to a less noble purpose,
having taken it to Falkirk Fair <em>with a drove of black cattle</em>.”
He took it much farther&mdash;to America, whither he went with his
regiment. There he lost his life in a duel, and it was lost too.
Perhaps it is preserved as a curiosity in some collection on the
other side of the Atlantic.</p>

<div class="sidenote">HIGHLAND FUNERALS.</div>

<p>I was shown also at a short distance eastwards from the Castle, at
the bottom of a crag by the roadside, a place known as the Cheese
Cave. Here at every funeral the refreshments used to be placed
for the mourners, who had often come twenty miles across the
hills. In former days, when there were more men and fewer sheep
some hundreds would assemble. “Two old respectable friends
were left behind to take care of the food and drink. When the
people came back from the grave-yard they refreshed themselves.
I have seen them,” continued my guide, “sitting on these rocks by
the cave having their luncheon.” Ramsay of Ochtertyre tells how
“the women of each valley through which the funeral passed
joined in the procession, but they attended but part of the way
and then returned. The whole company seemed to be running;
and wherever they rested small cairns or heaps of stones were
raised to commemorate the corpse having halted on that spot.”<a name="FNanchor_711_712" id="FNanchor_711_712"></a><a href="#Footnote_711_712" class="fnanchor">[711]</a>
These heaps were pointed out to us on the side of Rattachan as
we drove down to Glenelg. The silence of the Scotch funeral
shocked Wesley, who recorded on May 20, 1774: “When I see
in Scotland a coffin put into the earth and covered up without a
word spoken, it reminds me of what was spoken concerning Jehoiakin,
‘He shall be buried with the burial of an ass.’”<a name="FNanchor_712_713" id="FNanchor_712_713"></a><a href="#Footnote_712_713" class="fnanchor">[712]</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">{242}</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">THE OLD LAIRD AND THE NEW.</div>

<p>It is not with accounts of funerals that I must take my
leave of a place where I spent so pleasant a day, and had so
hospitable a reception. Here I saw not only the dead past but a
vigorous and hopeful present. Even the old Laird, we are told,
“was a very hearty and hospitable landlord,” though with his
belief in his rights of <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">furca et fossa</i> he certainly was an antediluvian.
His descendant does not yield to him in heartiness and
hospitality, but has other ways of guiding his people than gallows,
pit and dungeon. By his schools, his reading-room, his infirmary
and his schemes for developing the fisheries he has won their
affections. An old lady who had been allowed to visit the Castle,
meeting him by chance as she came out, full of anger at what she
had seen, exclaimed: “You ought, Sir, to be ashamed of your
ancestors.” “No,” he replied, “I am not ashamed of them. They
led their lives, and I lead mine.” They were at all events as good
as the men of their time, perhaps better. Old Lochbuy does not
seem to have been a bad fellow, though he was slow in learning
that he had lost his right to imprison his tenants. “May not a
man do what he likes with his own?” we can fancy him asking in
the words used more than seventy years later by an English duke.
Much as his descendant has done, there is one thing more which I
would ask him to do. He dreads, no doubt, the throng of noisy
tourists, but he might surely build a modest inn where the pensive
wanderer could find lodging, and enjoy the scenery of Lochbuy.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE FERRY FROM MULL TO OBAN.</div>

<p>On the morning of Friday, October 22, our travellers set out
for the ferry by which they were to cross to Oban&mdash;a distance of
about twelve miles. According to Dr. Garnett, travellers were
conveyed first to Kerrera, an island lying off the mainland. Crossing
this on foot or horseback they found awaiting them another boat to
take them to Oban. At Auchnacraig in Mull there was an inn
about half a mile from the ferry. Here he and his companion could
procure, he says, neither oats for their horses nor straw for their
litter. They wanted to give them a mess of oatmeal and water, but
the woman, who acted as hostler, at first refused, “asking whether<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">{243}</a></span>
it was proper to give the food of Christians to horses.” After
a long dispute she yielded. “In these islands,” he adds, “horses
seldom taste oats.”<a name="FNanchor_713_714" id="FNanchor_713_714"></a><a href="#Footnote_713_714" class="fnanchor">[713]</a> “The bottom of the ferry-boat,” says Boswell,
“was strewed with branches of trees or bushes upon which we sat.
We had a good day and a fine passage, and in the evening landed
at Oban, where we found a tolerable inn.” This place, which
I have seen recommended to cockney tourists in huge advertisements
as The Charing Cross of the North, was then a little hamlet.
In 1786 Knox found “about twenty families collected together
with a view to the fisheries.”<a name="FNanchor_714_715" id="FNanchor_714_715"></a><a href="#Footnote_714_715" class="fnanchor">[714]</a> It boasted of a custom-house and a
post-office. In the islands no customs were paid, for there was no
officer to demand them.<a name="FNanchor_715_716" id="FNanchor_715_716"></a><a href="#Footnote_715_716" class="fnanchor">[715]</a> Faujas Saint-Fond gives a curious
account of his stay in the inn, a few years after Johnson’s visit. He
would have got on very well, for the food though simple was good,
and his bed though hard was clean, had it not been for a performer
on the bag-pipes&mdash;“un maudit joueur de cornemuse” who played
“une musique d’un genre nouveau, mais bien terrible pour mon
oreille.” The day of their arrival this man had strutted up and
down before the inn with haughty and warlike looks, and had stunned
them with his airs. “Nous crûmes d’abord que ce personnage était
une espèce d’insensé qui gagnait sa vie à ce métier.” They were
informed that he was an accomplished musician, “de l’école<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">{244}</a></span>
<i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">highlandoise</i>,” and that in this display of his talents he was shewing
the joy which he felt on seeing strangers in a place where they
came so rarely. Touched by his friendly sentiments Saint-Fond
had not only applauded him, but had even pressed on him “quelques
shelings,” which he accepted, it almost seemed, merely out of complaisance.
Taking pity on the stranger’s solitude he came and
played under his bed-room window in the silence of the night. It
was all in vain that Saint-Fond rose, went out of doors, took him by
the hand and led him away. “Il revint au même moment, me
donnant à entendre qu’il n’était point fatigué, et qu’il jouerait toute
la nuit pour me plaire, et il tint parole.”<a name="FNanchor_716_717" id="FNanchor_716_717"></a><a href="#Footnote_716_717" class="fnanchor">[716]</a></p>

<p>The bagpiper was surely the direct ancestor of those bands of
musicians who at Oban distress the peaceful tourist. But there
are things worse even than
musicians. How melancholy
is the change which
has come over the whole
scene in the last quarter of
a century! A beautiful bay
ruined by man! That it
should become thronged
was inevitable; it need not
have been made vulgar. It
was on no scene of overgrown
hotels that Johnson
looked, as, with the tear
starting in his eye, he repeated those fine lines in which Goldsmith
describes the character of the British nation:</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE RIDE TO INVERARY.</div>

<p>The <cite>Traveller</cite> had formed the subject of their talk at breakfast,
and it was while Boswell helped Johnson on with his great-coat that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">{245}</a></span>
he recited these lines. They had a long ride before them through
heavy rain to Inverary. Loch Awe they crossed by the ferry
at Portsonachan&mdash;“a pretty wide lake,” as Boswell describes it, not
knowing its name. Towards evening they came to a good road
made by the soldiers, the first which they had seen since they left
Fort Augustus more than seven weeks before. Unwearied by his
long journey, Johnson that same night wrote a letter to Mrs.
Thrale in which he thus describes both what he saw and what he
felt.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“About ten miles of this day’s journey were uncommonly amusing. We travelled
with very little light in a storm of wind and rain; we passed about fifty-five streams
that crossed our way, and fell into a river that, for a very great part of our road
foamed and roared beside us. All the rougher powers of nature, except thunder,
were in motion, but there was no danger. I should have been sorry to have missed
any of the inconveniences, to have had more light or less rain, for their co-operation
crowded the scene and filled the mind.”</p></div>

<p>When an old man describes such a journey as “uncommonly
amusing” it is clear that he uses the term in a sense which it does
not bear at present. In his <cite>Dictionary</cite> he defines <em>amuse</em>, “to
entertain with tranquillity; to fill with thoughts that engage the
mind without distracting it.” The thoughts which this stormy
evening in late autumn engaged his mind amidst the wilds of
Argyleshire he put forth in a fine passage when, in the quietness of
his study, he came to write the account of his journey.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The night came on while we had yet a great part of the way to go, though not
so dark but that we could discern the cataracts which poured down the hills on one
side, and fell into one general channel, that ran with great violence on the other.
The wind was loud, the rain was heavy, and the whistling of the blast, the fall of the
shower, the rush of the cataracts, and the roar of the torrent, made a nobler chorus
of the rough musick of nature than it had ever been my chance to hear before.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">THE INN AT INVERARY.</div>

<p>The man who wrote this noble passage had not surely that
insensibility to nature which is so often laid to his charge. He was
sixty-four years old; mounted on a pony scarcely strong enough to
bear his weight, he had had a long and hard day’s ride through
wind and rain; he had dined in his wet clothes in a hut warmed by
a smoky turf fire, and yet at the end of the day he could say with
the enthusiasm of a young poet that neither darkness nor storm
would he willingly have had lessened. He was supported, no doubt,
in his recollections by the comforts of the inn at Inverary which
was, he said, “not only commodious, but magnificent.” Perhaps he
was inspired also by the gill of whisky which he called for&mdash;“the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">{246}</a></span>
first fermented liquor,” says Boswell, “that he tasted during his
travels.” He forgets, however, the brandy which he was prevailed
on to drink at Dunvegan when he was suffering from cold. “Come,
(said Johnson) let me know what it is that makes a Scotchman
happy.” He thought it preferable to any English malt brandy.
“What was the process,” he writes, “I had no opportunity of
enquiring, nor do I wish to improve the art of making poison
pleasant.” To the excellence of the inn at Inverary, Pennant also
bears testimony. Far otherwise does Burns speak of it, in his indignation
at the incivility of the landlord, whose whole attention
was occupied by the visitors of the Duke of Argyle.</p>

<div class="caption"><p>INVERARY CASTLE.</p></div>
</div>

<p>At Inverary our travellers rested from Saturday evening till
Tuesday morning. This pleasant little town had a very different,
look from that which it now bears. “This place,” wrote Pennant,
“will in time be very magnificent; but at present the space between
the front of the castle and the water is disgraced with the old town,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">{247}</a></span>
composed of the most wretched hovels that can be imagined.”<a name="FNanchor_717_718" id="FNanchor_717_718"></a><a href="#Footnote_717_718" class="fnanchor">[717]</a>
These have long been cleared away, so that there is now an unbroken
view over a finely wooded lawn of the loch and the hills
beyond. It was in the beginning of September, 1769, that he
visited the place. <span class="sidenote">SUNDAY ON LOCH FYNE.</span> “Every evening,” he says, “some hundreds of
boats cover the surface of Loch Fyne. On the week-days the
cheerful noise of the bag-pipe
and dance echoes from on
board; on the Sabbath each
boat approaches the land, and
psalmody and devotion divide
the day.” Our travellers were
perhaps too late in the year
to witness this curious scene;
at all events they make no
mention of it. Had they
heard the psalm-singing on
the Sunday they would not
have left it unnoticed. The
forenoon of that day they
“passed calmly and placidly.”
Of all the Sundays which I
passed in Scotland, nowhere
did I find such an unbroken
stillness as here. It was far
quieter than the towns, for the
people were as still as mice,
and it was quieter than the
country, for there was an
absence of country noises.
We were alone in our hotel.
It was the last day of June, but there were scarcely any other
strangers in the place to enjoy the beautiful scenery and the long
summer days.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE DUKE AND DUCHESS OF ARGYLE.</div>

<p>Boswell hesitated, or affected to hesitate, about calling on the
Duke of Argyle. “I had reason to think,” he writes, “that the
duchess disliked me on account of my zeal in the Douglas cause;
but the duke had always been pleased to treat me with great
civility.” The duchess was that famous beauty, Elizabeth Gunning,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_248" id="Page_248">{248}</a></span>
the wife of two dukes and the mother of four. Her sister had
married the Earl of Coventry. “The two beautiful sisters,” says
Horace Walpole, “were going on the stage, when they are at once
exalted almost as high as they could be, were countessed and double-duchessed.”<a name="FNanchor_718_719" id="FNanchor_718_719"></a><a href="#Footnote_718_719" class="fnanchor">[718]</a>
The duchess, by her first husband, the Duke of
Hamilton, was the mother of the unsuccessful competitor for the
Douglas estates, and was therefore “prejudiced against Boswell,
who had shown all
the bustling importance
of his character
in the Douglas
cause.”<a name="FNanchor_719_720" id="FNanchor_719_720"></a><a href="#Footnote_719_720" class="fnanchor">[719]</a> Johnson,
on hearing the state
of the case, “was
clear that Boswell
ought to pay his respects
at the castle.
I mentioned,” continues
Boswell, “that
I was afraid my
company might be
disagreeable to the
duchess. He treated
the objection with
a manly disdain,
‘<em>That</em>, Sir, he must
settle with his wife.’
He insisted that I
should not go to
the castle this day
before dinner, as it
would look like seeking an invitation. ‘But,’ said I, ‘if the duke
invites us to dine with him to-morrow, shall we accept?’ ‘Yes, Sir,’
I think he said, ‘to be sure.’ But he added, ‘He won’t ask us.’”
By the duke, who was sitting over his wine, Boswell was most
politely received; but when he was taken into the drawing-room
and introduced, neither the duchess nor the ladies with her took the
least notice of him. The following day he and Johnson were
shown through the castle. “It is a stately place,” said Johnson.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_249" id="Page_249">{249}</a></span>
“What I admire here is the total defiance of expense.” In a
low one-horse chair our two travellers were driven through “the
duke’s spacious park and rising forests.” <span class="sidenote">FINE OLD TREES AT INVERARY.</span> “I had,” writes Boswell,
“a particular pride in showing Dr. Johnson a great number of fine
old trees, to compensate for the nakedness which had made such an
impression on him on the eastern coast of Scotland.” Pennant
noticed pines nine feet, and beeches from nine to twelve feet in
girth, planted, it was said, by the Earl of Argyle who was beheaded
in 1685. They have grown to a noble size, and in one part form a
long avenue, which would grace that English county which takes its
name from its beech woods. Even in the Black Forest I do not
know that I have seen larger pines. The planting still goes on. A
fine young Spanish chestnut boasts in the inscription which it bears
that in the year 1858 it was planted by Lord Tennyson. “Would,”
I exclaimed as I read the words, “that twin chestnuts of stately
growth in like manner commemorated the visit of Johnson and
Boswell.” But Johnson’s trees are scattered broadcast over Scotland.

<p>The fine collection of arms of which he took much notice still
adorns the hall. Of the pictures no mention is made by either of
the travellers, though in more than one they might have recognized
the work of their friend Sir Joshua. Here is his full-length portrait
of the beautiful duchess, “about whom the world had gone
mad” one-and-twenty years before. When she was presented at<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_250" id="Page_250">{250}</a></span>
Court, “the crowd was so great,” writes Horace Walpole, “that
even the noble mob in the drawing-room clambered upon chairs
and tables to look at her.” As she passed down to Scotland,
“seven hundred people,” it was reported, “sat up all night in and
about an inn in Yorkshire to see her get into her post-chaise next
morning.”<a name="FNanchor_720_721" id="FNanchor_720_721"></a><a href="#Footnote_720_721" class="fnanchor">[720]</a> Here, too, is a small but lovely picture of her sister,
the Countess of Coventry. On her going down to her husband’s
country seat near Worcester, “a shoemaker in that town got two
guineas and a half by showing a shoe that he was making for her
at a penny a-piece.”<a name="FNanchor_721_722" id="FNanchor_721_722"></a><a href="#Footnote_721_722" class="fnanchor">[721]</a> In striking contrast with the two sisters are
many of the portraits which hang on the walls. It is a strange company
which is brought together: Mary, Queen of Scots, and her

<div class="sidenote">DINNER AT INVERARY.</div>

<p>The room in which our travellers dined is much in the state in
which they saw it; the walls panelled with the same festoons, and
the chairs adorned with the same gilding and the same tapestry.
But it is turned to other uses. No “splendid dinner” is served up
in it such as Johnson enjoyed and praised; no “luxuries” such as
he defended. No Lady Betty Hamilton can quietly take her chair
after dinner, and lean upon the back of it, as she listens eagerly to
the great talker, who is unaware that she is just behind him. No
Boswell can with a steady countenance have the satisfaction for
once to look a duchess in the face, as with a respectful air he drinks
to her good health. The tables are covered with books and magazines,
and pamphlets, and correspondence. It is the duke’s business-room
where he sees his chamberlain,<a name="FNanchor_722_723" id="FNanchor_722_723"></a><a href="#Footnote_722_723" class="fnanchor">[722]</a> and where his librarian<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_252" id="Page_252">{252}</a></span>
receives and sorts the new publications which are ever coming in,
before he transfers them to the shelves of the library.</p>

<p>The noble drawing-room remains unchanged&mdash;the gilded ceiling,
the old French tapestry covering the walls, the gilt tapestry chairs,
the oaken floor, up and down which the duke and Boswell walked
conversing, while her grace made Dr. Johnson come and sit by her.
All is the same, except that time has dealt kindly by the tapestry
and the gilding, and refined them in their fading.</p>

<p>Faujas Saint-Fond, who spent three days in the castle a few
years later, is full of praise of everything which he saw. The duke
and his family, he says, spoke French with a purity not unworthy
of the highest society
in Paris. The cookery,
with the exception of
a few dishes, was
French, and was excellent.
There was an
abundance of hot-house
fruits. There
were silver forks instead
of “ces petits
tridens d’acier bien
aigus, en forme de
dard, fixés sur un
manche, dont on se
sert ordinairement en

napkins on the table, a rare sight in England. The hours of meals
were, breakfast at ten o’clock, dinner at half-past four, and supper at
ten. At dinner, after the ladies had withdrawn, “la cérémonie
des <em>toasts</em>” lasted at least three-quarters of an hour!<a name="FNanchor_724_725" id="FNanchor_724_725"></a><a href="#Footnote_724_725" class="fnanchor">[724]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD MACAULAY’S GRANDFATHER.</div>

<p>At Inverary Johnson met not only the descendants of a long line<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_253" id="Page_253">{253}</a></span>
of famous statesmen, but also the ancestor of a great historian.
Lord Macaulay’s grandfather was at this time Minister of
Inverary. He passed the evening with our travellers at their inn
after they had returned from dining at the Castle, and got somewhat
roughly handled in talk.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When Dr. Johnson spoke of people whose principles were good, but whose
practice was faulty, Mr. Macaulay said, he had no notion of people being in earnest
in their good professions, whose practice was not suitable to them. The doctor
grew warm, and said, ‘Sir, are you so grossly ignorant of human nature, as not to
know that a man may be very sincere in good principles, without having good practice?’”</p></div>

<p>On this Sir George Trevelyan remarks in his life of his uncle:&mdash;“When
we think what well-known ground this was to Lord
Macaulay it is impossible to suppress a wish that the great talker
had been at hand to avenge his grandfather and grand-uncle.”<a name="FNanchor_725_726" id="FNanchor_725_726"></a><a href="#Footnote_725_726" class="fnanchor">[725]</a>
“A hundred to one on Sam Johnson,” say we. It is a pity that it
was not at the Manse that they spent that Sunday evening; for
there the little child who was one day to make the name of Zachary
Macaulay famous as the liberator of the slaves would have gazed
with eager open eyes on the great Englishman, who had startled
the grave men at Oxford by giving as his toast:&mdash;“Here’s to the
next insurrection of the negroes in the West-Indies.”</p>

<p>The Duke of Argyle, who had heard Dr. Johnson complain that
the shelties were too small for his weight, “was obliging enough to
mount him on a stately steed from his Grace’s stable.” Joseph
(Boswell’s servant), said:&mdash;“He now looks like a bishop.” Leaving
Inverary on the morning of Tuesday, October 26, they rode round
the head of Loch Fyne through Glencroe to Tarbet on Loch
Lomond. Boswell, who was becoming somewhat indolent in keeping
his journal, passes over this part of their tour in silence. Saint-Fond
speaks of the Glen as “ce triste passage.” Pennant describes
it as “the seat of melancholy,” and Johnson as “a black and dreary
region. At the top of the hill,” he adds, “is a seat with this
inscription, ‘Rest and be thankful.’ Stones were placed to mark
the distances, which the inhabitants have taken away, resolved,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_254" id="Page_254">{254}</a></span>

Wolfe’s men had been working twenty years earlier.</p>

is no longer a seat where his
weary limbs may repose.
Perhaps some day it will be
restored with the old inscription
and the following addition:&mdash;“James

Glencroe is but little changed since Johnson looked upon it. It is
still lonely and grand. The tourist’s carriage breaks the quiet from
time to time, but it soon sinks back into “sublimity, silence and
solitude.” When we passed through it there was no succession of
cataracts and no roaring torrent such as Johnson described. The
long drought had made a silence in the hills. We met only one
tourist&mdash;a lad on his bicycle who had escaped that morning from
the smoke of Glasgow, and full of eagerness and life, was pressing
on to the inn where his long ride of fifty miles would find its pleasant
termination in dinner and a bed. I called to mind how seven and
thirty years before when I was just such another youngster, as
I was crossing the top of the Glen, I had seen in the distance<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_255" id="Page_255">{255}</a></span>
something white fluttering in the wind. It was a big Highlander
returning, as he told us, from Glasgow. Overcome by the heat of
the day, and incommoded by a garment to which he was not much
accustomed, he had taken off his trousers and was carrying them
on his shoulders. It was his shirt that had caught my eye.</p>

<div class="sidenote">A JUDGE ON CIRCUIT.</div>

<p>At Tarbet our travellers dined at the little inn on the bank of
Loch Lomond. Here, a few years later, Saint-Fond and his party
arrived very late on a rainy night in September. They were on
their way from Glasgow to Inverary, and had meant to rest at Luss.
Unfortunately for them it was the time of the autumn circuit.
The inn looked like a fisherman’s hut. The landlady coming out
made them a sign that they must not utter a sound. They were
thrust into a stable, where she said:&mdash;“Le lord juge me fait
l’honorable faveur dans sa tournée de loger chez moi; il est là;
chacun doit respecter ce qu’il fait; il dort.” She added that she
could take in neither them nor their horses. They remonstrated,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_256" id="Page_256">{256}</a></span>
“Point de bruit, ne troublez pas le sommeil du juge, respect à la
loi; soyez heureux et partez.” They had no help for it, but drove
on with their weary horses through the night and the heavy rain to
Tarbet, where they arrived between three and four next morning.
There they found all the beds occupied by jurymen, who were on
their way to Inverary. The landlady did what she could to make
them comfortable, and gave them some good tea in a set of China
cups which had been given her by the Duchess of Argyle.<a name="FNanchor_728_729" id="FNanchor_728_729"></a><a href="#Footnote_728_729" class="fnanchor">[728]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD JEFFREY AT TARBET.</div>

<p>At Stuckgown, close to Tarbet, Lord Jeffrey for many years
passed a few weeks of every summer, in a quietness and solitude
which have for ever fled the place. Writing from Tarbet on August 5,
1818, he says: “Here we are in a little inn on the banks of Loch
Lomond, in the midst of the mists of the mountains, the lakes,
heaths, rocks, and cascades which have been my passion since I was
a boy, and to which, like a boy, I have run away the instant I could
get my hands clear of law, and review, and Edinburgh. They
have no post-horses in the Highlands, and we sent away those that
brought us here, with orders to come back for us to morrow, and
so we are left without a servant, entirely at the mercy of the
natives.” He goes on to mention a steam-boat “which circumnavigates
the whole lake every day in about ten hours. It was
certainly very strange and striking to hear and see it hissing and
roaring past the headlands of our little bay, foaming and spouting
like an angry whale; but on the whole it rather vulgarises the
scene too much, and I am glad that it is found not to answer, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_257" id="Page_257">{257}</a></span>
is to be dropped next year.”<a name="FNanchor_729_730" id="FNanchor_729_730"></a><a href="#Footnote_729_730" class="fnanchor">[729]</a> At Tarbet the tourist who is
oppressed with the size of the hotel and the army of waiters, and
who sees the pier as I saw it crowned with an automatic sweetmeat
machine, may well wish that the steam-boat had never been
found to answer. The scene is hopelessly vulgarised. It is fast
sinking into the paradise of cockneys. I asked for that variety of
bread which I remember to have seen served up there thirty-seven
years ago. I was scornfully told that in those days the Scotch had
not known how to bake, but that now they could make a large loaf
as well as anyone. At Inverary I had in vain asked for oat-cakes
at my hotel. If Johnson were to make his journey in these present
times, and were confined to the big tourists’ hotels, he would
certainly no longer say that an epicure, wherever he had supped,
would wish to breakfast in Scotland.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COLQUHOUNS OF ROSEDEW.</div>

<p>From Tarbet he rode along the shores of Loch Lomond to
Rosedew,<a name="FNanchor_730_731" id="FNanchor_730_731"></a><a href="#Footnote_730_731" class="fnanchor">[730]</a> the house of Sir
James Colquhoun. “It was
a place,” says the historian
of Dumbartonshire, “rich
in historic associations, but
about 1770 it was superseded
by a new mansion, to
which large additions have
since been made.”<a name="FNanchor_731_732" id="FNanchor_731_732"></a><a href="#Footnote_731_732" class="fnanchor">[731]</a> Here Boswell passed in review Johnson’s
courteous behaviour at Inverary, and said, “‘You were quite a
fine gentleman when with the duchess.’ He answered in good
humour, ‘Sir, I look upon myself as a very polite man.’” Next
morning “we took,” writes Johnson, “a boat to rove upon the
lake. It has about thirty islands, of which twenty belong to Sir
James. Young Colquhoun<a name="FNanchor_732_733" id="FNanchor_732_733"></a><a href="#Footnote_732_733" class="fnanchor">[732]</a> went into the boat with us, but a
little agitation of the water frighted him to shore. We passed
up and down and landed upon one small island,<a name="FNanchor_733_734" id="FNanchor_733_734"></a><a href="#Footnote_733_734" class="fnanchor">[733]</a> on which are the
ruins of a castle; and upon another much larger, which serves Sir
James for a park, and is remarkable for a large wood of yew trees.”
Just one hundred years later, on December 18, 1873, that very fate
befell one of his descendants which the young Colquhoun dreaded<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">{258}</a></span>
for himself. In the darkness of a winter’s evening his boat was
upset as he was coming home from the Yew Island, and he was
drowned with three of his gamekeepers and a boy. It was never
known how the accident happened, for no one escaped; but the
boat was heavily laden with the dead bodies of some stags, which
they had shot in the island, and the unhappy men were weighed
down with their accoutrements and the ammunition which they
carried. The yew trees were planted, it was said, on the advice of
King Robert Bruce, in order to furnish the Lennox men with
trusty bows.<a name="FNanchor_734_735" id="FNanchor_734_735"></a><a href="#Footnote_734_735" class="fnanchor">[734]</a> The old castle, “on which the osprey built her
annual nest,” is so much buried in ivy that it is not easily distinguished
from the surrounding woods. <span class="sidenote">ROVING ON LOCH LOMOND.</span> We hired a boat at Luss
and in our turn roved upon the lake. We landed on one of the
islands and lunched on the top of a rock by the ruins of a second
castle. Loch Lomond, studded with islands, lay like a mirror
beneath us, with the huge Ben Lomond for a noble background.
From time to time a boat broke the smoothness of the water, and
the cry of a gull, or the bark of a far-away dog, the stillness of the
air. We spoke of the heat and bustle of the world, but imagination
almost refused to picture them in so peaceful a spot. Our boatman<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_259" id="Page_259">{259}</a></span>
was a man of a strong mind, which had not been suffered to
lie barren. He bore his part well in a talk on books. I had
chanced to mention the serfs who worked in the coal-mines and
salt-pans in Scotland; he at once struck into the conversation.
“Sir Walter Scott,” he said, “makes one of his characters say, ‘he
would not take him back like a collier on a salter.’ This made me
look the matter up for I did not understand what he meant.” He
praised the old Scotch common schools. “We Scotchmen,” he
proudly said, “have had education for three hundred years. A
Scotch working-man would starve to death to give his son a good
education.” <span class="sidenote">OLD AND NEW DOMINIES.</span>
The present race of schoolmasters who are “paid by
results,” he contrasted unfavourably with those whom he had
known in his boyhood. “The old Dominies would willingly teach
all that they knew, and grudged no time to a boy who was eager
for knowledge; but now they are like other people, and when they
have done their day’s work they will do no more.” In the village
club to which he belonged, they had in the last two or three
winters engaged for a few weeks a young Glasgow student to teach
them elocution, “for how could they enjoy Shakespeare if they did
not know how to read him properly?” He praised the Colquhouns.
“They would never send any of their tenants to prison for poaching.
They might fine them, but the money they would give away in
charity.” He spoke of the old clan feeling, and of the protection
given by the laird. His grandfather, who was a farmer, a Macpherson
by name, had married a Macqueen.<a name="FNanchor_735_736" id="FNanchor_735_736"></a><a href="#Footnote_735_736" class="fnanchor">[735]</a> On a rapid fall in
the price of Highland cattle he fell into money difficulties, and
was harshly threatened with a forced sale by one of his creditors.
The Laird of the Macqueens said significantly to this man: “You
may do whatever you like against Macpherson, but remember that
his wife is a Macqueen.” The hint was enough, and the proceedings
were at once dropped. Our boatman had read Johnson’s
<cite>Journey to the Western Islands</cite>, but said that Scotchmen feel too
sore about him to like reading him. I opened the book, for I had
it with me, and read the concluding words in which he says:
“Novelty and ignorance must always be reciprocal, and I cannot
but be conscious that my thoughts on national manners are the
thoughts of one who has seen but little.” My boatman was much
struck with his modesty, and seemed to think that he had formed
too severe a judgment.</p>

<p>Boswell was not so careful in recording Johnson’s talk on the
Lake as I was with our boatman’s. “I recollect,” he writes,
“none of his conversation, except that, when talking of dress, he
said, ‘Sir, were I to have any thing fine, it should be very fine.
Were I to wear a ring, it should not be a bauble, but a stone of
great value. Were I to wear a laced or embroidered waistcoat, it
should be very rich. I had once a very rich laced waistcoat, which
I wore the first night of my tragedy.’” Johnson, nearly five and
twenty years before, sat in one of the side-boxes of Drury Lane
Theatre, in a scarlet waistcoat, with rich gold lace, and a gold-laced
hat, listening to the catcalls whistling before the curtain rose;
how little could he have thought that one day he would boast of
his costume as he was roving in a boat upon Loch Lomond!</p>

<p>In the evening they drove to Cameron, the seat of Commissary
Smollett. It was the first drive which they had taken since at
Inverness they began their <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">equitation</i> full two months earlier.
“Our satisfaction,” says Boswell, “of [<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">sic</i>] finding ourselves again in a
comfortable carriage was very great. We had a pleasing conviction
of the commodiousness of civilisation, and heartily laughed at
the ravings of those absurd visionaries who have attempted to
persuade us of the superior advantages of a <em>state of nature</em>.” With
these visionaries Boswell himself sometimes sided. The people of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_261" id="Page_261">{261}</a></span>
Otaheite especially had won his admiration. “No, Sir;” said
Johnson to him on one such occasion: “You are not to talk such
paradox; let me have no more on’t. It cannot entertain, far less can
it instruct.” “Don’t cant in defence of savages,” he said, on another
occasion. At Cameron they had none of this fanciful talk. Their
host “was a man of considerable learning, with abundance of
animal spirits; so that he was a very good companion for Dr.
Johnson, who said, ‘We have had more solid talk here than at
any place where we have been.’” He was a relation of the great
novelist, and one of the four judges of the Commissary Court in
Edinburgh. It was the sole court
in Scotland which took cognisance
of actions about marriage, and the
Supreme Court in all questions of
probate. “It sat,” says the lively
Topham, “in a little room of about
ten feet square; from the darkness
and dirtiness of it you would rather
imagine that those who were brought
into it were confined there.” The
judges were paid rather by perquisites
than by salaries. In each

Johnson, no doubt, was kept in the best of humours by the sight of
a great many letters from England, after the long interval of sixty-eight
days during which not a line had reached him. “He enjoyed
in imagination the comforts which we could now command, and
seemed to be in high glee. I remember, he put a leg up on each
side of the grate, and said, with a mock solemnity, by way of
soliloquy, but loud enough for me to hear it: ‘Here am I, an
ENGLISH man, sitting by a <em>coal</em> fire.’” Of fires made by peat,
that “sullen fuel,” he had had enough in the last two months. All
along the sea-board coal was made artificially dear by the folly of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_263" id="Page_263">{263}</a></span>
Parliament. A duty of five shillings and fourpence per chaldron,
says Knox, was levied on coal at ports; none on inland coal. It
had to be landed at a port where there is a custom-house, and might
then be re-shipped for some other place in the neighbourhood.<a name="FNanchor_741_742" id="FNanchor_741_742"></a><a href="#Footnote_741_742" class="fnanchor">[741]</a>
Custom-houses were few and far between, so that in many cases,
if coal was used at all, it would have had to be twice landed and
twice shipped. On this mischievous regulation Adam Smith remarks:
“Where coals are naturally cheap they are consumed duty
free; where they are naturally dear, they are loaded with a heavy
duty.”<a name="FNanchor_742_743" id="FNanchor_742_743"></a><a href="#Footnote_742_743" class="fnanchor">[742]</a></p>

<p>The “Saracen’s Head” with its coal fire has disappeared. My
boatman had heard the old people talk of it. In this inn the following
morning Dr. Reid, the philosopher, and two of the other professors
of the University breakfasted with Johnson. He met some of them
also at dinner, tea, and supper. “I was not much pleased with
any of them,” he wrote to Mrs. Thrale. Boswell unfortunately
was again lazy with his journal, and kept no record of the talk. <span class="sidenote">THE GLASGOW PROFESSORS.</span> Writing long afterwards, he says: “The general impression upon
my memory is, that we had not much conversation at Glasgow,
where the professors, like their brethren at Aberdeen, did not
venture to expose themselves much to the battery of cannon which
they knew might play upon them.” Reid’s silence was perhaps
merely due to that reserve which he generally shewed among
strangers.<a name="FNanchor_743_744" id="FNanchor_743_744"></a><a href="#Footnote_743_744" class="fnanchor">[743]</a> Had fate been kinder, the great Clow might have been
still among them, who twenty-two years before had been preferred

of Logic.<a name="FNanchor_744_745" id="FNanchor_744_745"></a><a href="#Footnote_744_745" class="fnanchor">[744]</a> The story of the Billingsgate altercation between
Smith and Johnson, recorded by Sir Walter Scott, is wholly
untrue. Smith was not at this time in Glasgow. It is, no doubt,
one of those tales about Johnson in which Scotch invention was
humorously displayed. It was, perhaps, meant as a reply to the
question which one day, in London, he put to Adam Smith, who
was boasting of Glasgow, “Pray, sir, have you ever seen Brentford?”
Boswell says: “I put him in mind of it to-day while he
expressed his admiration of the elegant buildings, and whispered
him, ‘Don’t you feel some remorse?’” Smith’s pride in the city
where he had spent more than three years as a student, and twelve
as a professor, was assuredly well-founded. Johnson calls it<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_264" id="Page_264">{264}</a></span>
“opulent and handsome,” and Boswell “beautiful.” <span class="sidenote">GLASGOW IN DAYS OF OLD.</span> Nearly two
centuries earlier Camden had said that “for pleasant situation,

Defoe describes it as “indeed a very fine city; the four principal
streets are the fairest for breadth, and the finest built that I have
ever seen in one city together. It is the cleanest, and beautifullest,
and best built city in Britain, London excepted.”<a name="FNanchor_746_747" id="FNanchor_746_747"></a><a href="#Footnote_746_747" class="fnanchor">[746]</a> Another

up to the top of the cathedral steeple. “It gave us a fine prospect,”
he writes, “both of the city and the adjacent country. A
more fruitful and better cultivated plain is scarce to be seen in
England.”<a name="FNanchor_748_749" id="FNanchor_748_749"></a><a href="#Footnote_748_749" class="fnanchor">[748]</a> Smollett swells the general chorus of praise: “Glasgow
is the pride of Scotland. It is one of the prettiest towns in
Europe.”<a name="FNanchor_749_750" id="FNanchor_749_750"></a><a href="#Footnote_749_750" class="fnanchor">[749]</a> Pennant, who visited it the year before Johnson, calls
it “the best built of any second-rate city I ever saw. The view
from the Cross has an air of vast magnificence.”<a name="FNanchor_750_751" id="FNanchor_750_751"></a><a href="#Footnote_750_751" class="fnanchor">[750]</a></p>

<p>At the Rebellion of 1745 the citizens had shown the greatest
loyalty. They raised and supported at their own expense two
battalions of six hundred men each, who joined the duke’s army.
Their town was occupied by the Pretender’s forces, who for ten days
lived there at free quarters. They had had to pay, moreover, two
heavy fines, amounting to more than nine thousand pounds, imposed
on them for their fidelity to the Hanoverian Family. In 1749, in
answer to their petition for relief, they received a grant from Parliament
of ten thousand pounds.<a name="FNanchor_751_752" id="FNanchor_751_752"></a><a href="#Footnote_751_752" class="fnanchor">[751]</a> On April 24 of that same year
a stage-coach began to run between Glasgow and Edinburgh,
starting from Edinburgh every Monday and Thursday, and from
Glasgow every Tuesday and Friday. “Every person pays nine
shillings fare, and is allowed a stone-weight of luggage.”<a name="FNanchor_752_753" id="FNanchor_752_753"></a><a href="#Footnote_752_753" class="fnanchor">[752]</a> By the
year 1783 far greater facilities were afforded. In John Tait’s
<cite>Directory for Glasgow</cite> of that year (p. 77) it is announced that
“three machines set out from each town every day at eight morning.
They stop on the road and change horses. Tickets, 10<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_265" id="Page_265">{265}</a></span>
each.” There was another daily “machine” belonging to a different
set of proprietors, besides one which ran only three times a week,
and charged but 8<abbr title="shillings">s.</abbr> 6<abbr title="pence">d.</abbr> “The Carlisle Diligence,” it is announced,
“sets out every lawful day.”</p>

<p>As we gaze on the filthy river which runs by the large city, on
the dense cloud of smoke which hangs over it, on the grimy streets
which have swallowed up the country far and wide, while we exult
in the display of man’s ingenuity and strength, and in the commerce
by which the good things of earth are so swiftly and cheaply
interchanged, we may mourn over the beautiful little town among
the apple-trees which stood so deliciously on the banks of the fair
and pure stream that ran to seawards beneath the arches of the old
stone bridge. How far removed from us are those days when
Glasgow was pillaged by the wild rabble of Highlanders! Yet I
have an uncle<a name="FNanchor_753_754" id="FNanchor_753_754"></a><a href="#Footnote_753_754" class="fnanchor">[753]</a> still living who remembers his grandfather and his
grandfather’s brother, one of whom had climbed up a tree to see
the other march with a body of Worcestershire volunteers against
the Young Pretender.</p>

<p>Johnson, after seeing the sights of the city, visited the college.
“It has not had,” he writes, “a sufficient share of the increasing
magnificence of the place.” From the account which Dr. Alexander
Carlyle gives of the citizens, as he had known them about
thirty years earlier, they were not likely to trouble themselves much
about the glory of their University. With a few exceptions they
were “shopkeepers and mechanics, or successful pedlars, who occupied
large warerooms full of manufactures of all sorts to furnish a
cargo to Virginia. In those accomplishments and that taste that
belong to people of opulence, much more to persons of education,
they were far behind the citizens of Edinburgh.” There was not
a teacher of French or of music in the whole town. <span class="sidenote">GLASGOW UNIVERSITY.</span> Nevertheless,
in the University itself he found “learning an object of more
importance, and the habit of application much more general” than
in the rival institution in the capital.<a name="FNanchor_754_755" id="FNanchor_754_755"></a><a href="#Footnote_754_755" class="fnanchor">[754]</a> Wesley compared the two
squares which formed the college with the small quadrangles of
Lincoln College, Oxford, of which he was a Fellow, and did not
think them larger, or at all handsomer. He was surprised at the
dress of the students. “They wear scarlet gowns, reaching only
to their knees. Most I saw were very dirty, some very ragged,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_266" id="Page_266">{266}</a></span>
and all of very coarse cloth.”<a name="FNanchor_755_756" id="FNanchor_755_756"></a><a href="#Footnote_755_756" class="fnanchor">[755]</a> How much more surprised would
he have been at the far shorter gowns now worn by the commoners
in his own university, showing, as they do, a raggedness
which is not the effect of age and wear, but of intentional mutilation!
There is an affectation of antiquity quite as much in a
freshman’s gown, as in the pedigree of some upstart who boasts
that he is sprung from the Plantagenets. The college numbered
at this time about four hundred students, most of whom lived in
lodgings, but some boarded with the professors.<a name="FNanchor_756_757" id="FNanchor_756_757"></a><a href="#Footnote_756_757" class="fnanchor">[756]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">PRINCIPAL LEECHMAN.</div>

<p>The principal was Dr. Leechman, whose sermon on prayer had
once raised a storm “among the high-flying clergy.”<a name="FNanchor_757_758" id="FNanchor_757_758"></a><a href="#Footnote_757_758" class="fnanchor">[757]</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In his house Dr. Johnson had the satisfaction of being told that his name had
been gratefully celebrated in one of the parochial congregations in the Highlands,
as the person to whose influence it was chiefly owing that the New Testament was
allowed to be translated into the Erse language. It seems some political members
of the Society in Scotland for propagating Christian Knowledge had opposed this
pious undertaking, as tending to preserve the distinction between the Highlanders
and Lowlanders.”</p></div>

<p>Johnson, in a letter full of generous indignation, had maintained
that “he that voluntarily continues ignorance, is guilty of
all the crimes which ignorance produces,” and had compared these
political Christians to the planters of America, “a race of mortals
whom, I suppose, no other man wishes to resemble.”<a name="FNanchor_758_759" id="FNanchor_758_759"></a><a href="#Footnote_758_759" class="fnanchor">[758]</a> Though he
was no doubt struck by Leechman’s appearance, “which was that
of an ascetic, reduced by fasting and prayer,” yet in his talk he
could have had no pleasure. “He was not able to carry on
common conversation, and when he spoke at all, it was a short
lecture.” The young students who were invited to his house,
longed to be summoned from the library to tea in the drawing-room,
where his wife “maintained a continued conversation on
plays, novels, poetry, and the fashions.”<a name="FNanchor_759_760" id="FNanchor_759_760"></a><a href="#Footnote_759_760" class="fnanchor">[759]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE ROAD TO AUCHINLECK.</div>

<p>On Saturday, October 30, our travellers set out on their way to
Boswell’s home at Auchinleck, in Ayrshire. Part of the way must<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_267" id="Page_267">{267}</a></span>
have been over a wild country, for a few years earlier, in his “Instructions”
for his friend Temple on his tour to Auchinleck, he
writes: “Set out [from Glasgow] for Kingswell, to which you have
a good road; arrived there, get a guide to put you through the
muir to Loudoun.”<a name="FNanchor_760_761" id="FNanchor_760_761"></a><a href="#Footnote_760_761" class="fnanchor">[760]</a> He and Johnson did not go the whole distance
in one day, though they had but thirty-four miles to travel.
They broke their journey at the house of Mr. Campbell, of Treesbank,
who had married Mrs. Boswell’s sister. Here they rested
till Tuesday. At a few miles distance Robert Burns, a lad of
thirteen, “a dexterous ploughman for his age,” was spending his
boyhood “in unceasing moil” and hardship, not having as yet
“committed the sin of rhyme.” Boswell, I believe, much as he
admired Allan Ramsay’s poem in the Scottish dialect, <cite>The Gentle
Shepherd</cite>, never makes mention of Burns, and Burns only once
mentions him. In the <cite>Author’s Earnest Cry and Prayer</cite>, written
before the year 1786, he says:</p>

</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">“KING BOB’S” CASTLE.</div>

<p>Dundonald Castle, in which Robert II. lived and died, our travellers
visited on Monday morning. “It has long been unroofed,” writes
Boswell, “and though of considerable size we could not by any
power of imagination, figure it as having been a suitable habitation
for majesty. Dr. Johnson, to irritate my <em>old Scottish</em> enthusiasm,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_268" id="Page_268">{268}</a></span>
was very jocular on the homely accommodation of “King <em>Bob</em>,”
and roared and laughed till the ruins echoed.”</p>

<p>The castle belongs to two periods. The original keep was
eighty-one feet long, forty broad, and seventy high. It was afterwards
lengthened at the southern end by seventeen feet. “The
great hall has been a very noble apartment.”<a name="FNanchor_763_764" id="FNanchor_763_764"></a><a href="#Footnote_763_764" class="fnanchor">[763]</a> Boswell justly
praises the view. “It stands,” he says, “on a beautiful rising
ground, which is seen at a great distance on several quarters, and
from whence there is an extensive prospect of the rich district of
Cunninghame, the western sea, the isle of Arran, and a part of the
northern coast of Ireland.” Camden quaintly says that “the name
<em>Cunninghame</em>, if one interpret it, is as much as the <em>Kings Habitation</em>,
by which a man may guess how commodious and pleasant it
is.”<a name="FNanchor_764_765" id="FNanchor_764_765"></a><a href="#Footnote_764_765" class="fnanchor">[764]</a> As I sat on the Castle hill, and looked over the fine country
to the north-west, I could have wished that the tall chimneys of
Irvine, pouring forth clouds of smoke, had been out of sight. In
the plain, at the distance of about a mile, a thin line of steam
showed where a heavy train was creeping along the railway. Just
beneath us the low spire of the church rose among the trees, while
in the gardens of the cottages that clustered around it there was an
abundance of fruit trees and of vegetables which would have delighted
Johnson’s heart, such as “King Bob” never saw or even
dreamt of. Beyond the village were undulating fields of well-cultivated
land. To the west, almost within bow-shot, stands a
steep rocky hill&mdash;a counterpart of that on which the castle is
placed&mdash;all covered with wood. High over the old ruins the
swifts were flying and screaming. The sole tenants of the great
hall were some black cattle whom my entrance disturbed. Where
kings once kept their court, and frowned and were flattered,</p>

<div class="verse indent2">“There but houseless cattle go</div>
<div class="verse">To shield them from the storm.”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>High up on the wall of the keep there are two stone shields, on
which still can be traced the royal and the Stewart arms. Little
did they who carved them think that the day was to come when
they would have sunk into the ornaments of a cow-house.</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COUNTESS OF EGLINTOUNE.</div>

<p>From Dundonald our travellers rode on a short distance
to Auchans, the house of the Dowager Countess of Eglintoune.
Johnson, in a letter to Mrs. Thrale, describes her as “a lady who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_269" id="Page_269">{269}</a></span>
for many years gave the laws of elegance to Scotland. She is in
full vigour of mind, and not much impaired in form. She is only
eighty-three. She was remarking that her marriage was in the
year eight; and I told her my birth was in nine. ‘Then,’ says
she, ‘I am just old enough to be your mother, and I will take you
for my son.’ She called Boswell the boy. ‘Yes, Madam,’ said I,
‘we will send him to school.’ ‘He is already,’ said she, ‘in a good
school;’ and expressed her hope of his improvement. At last
night came, and I was sorry to leave her.” “She had been,” writes
Boswell, “the admiration of the gay circles of life, and the patroness
of poets.” To her Allan Ramsay had dedicated his <cite>Gentle Shepherd</cite>,
and Hamilton of Bangour had addressed verses. With his
reception Johnson was delighted, so congenial were their principles
in church and state. “In her bed-rooms,” says Dr. Robert
Chambers, “was hung a portrait of her sovereign <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">de jure</i>, the ill-starred
Charles Edward, so situated as to be the first object
which met her sight on awaking in the morning.”<a name="FNanchor_765_766" id="FNanchor_765_766"></a><a href="#Footnote_765_766" class="fnanchor">[765]</a> She who<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_270" id="Page_270">{270}</a></span>
had patronised poets and worshipped princes in her last years
amused herself by taming rats. “She had a panel in the oak
wainscot of her dining-room, which she tapped upon and opened
at meal-times, when ten or twelve jolly rats came tripping forth
and joined her at table.” She died in 1780, at the age of ninety-one.<a name="FNanchor_766_767" id="FNanchor_766_767"></a><a href="#Footnote_766_767" class="fnanchor">[766]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">OLD AUCHANS.</div>

<p>Auchans&mdash;Old Auchans as it is now called&mdash;since the countess’s
death has been chiefly inhabited by caretakers. It was built in
1644, at a time when in the houses of the great comfort was more
studied than means of defence. Nevertheless “we find some shot-holes
near the entrance doorway.”<a name="FNanchor_767_768" id="FNanchor_767_768"></a><a href="#Footnote_767_768" class="fnanchor">[767]</a> It is finely placed among the
trees, with views of Dundonald Castle on one side and of the sea
in the distance on the other. The interior has been greatly altered
by the division of rooms and
blocking up of windows and
passages. We were only
shown a small part of it, and
looked with sadness on the
broken ceiling in what by
tradition is known as the
dining-room. It is a pity that
so interesting and so fine a
building should have suffered
under the neglect of a whole
century. It is so strongly
built that it looks as if it
could, at no excessive expense, be once more made habitable.
Johnson had not been easily persuaded to visit it, but “he was so
much pleased with his entertainment, that he owned,” says Boswell,
“that I had done well to force him out.” No less pleased was the
old countess, “who, when they were going away, embraced him,
saying, ‘My dear son, farewell.’” Neither of this visit nor of one
which he had paid two days earlier to the Earl of Loudoun, who
“jumped for joy” at the thought of seeing him, does he make any
mention in his book. He was the last man to indulge “in that
vain ostentatious importance,” which he censured in many people,
“of quoting the authority of dukes and lords.” He merely says
that, “on our way from Glasgow to Auchinleck we found several<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_271" id="Page_271">{271}</a></span>
places remarkable enough in themselves, but already described
by those who viewed them at more leisure, or with much more
skill.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD AUCHINLECK.</div>

<p>On Tuesday, November 2, our travellers having ordered a
chaise from Kilmarnock, drove to Auchinleck, where they arrived
in time for dinner. “We purpose,” wrote Johnson that same
evening, “to stay here some days, more or fewer, as we are used.”
He said “we” advisedly, for he knew that not only between Lord
Auchinleck and himself there was little in common, but that also
between the father and son there was no freedom of intercourse.
“My father,” Boswell once complained, “cannot bear that his son
should talk with him as a man.”<a name="FNanchor_768_769" id="FNanchor_768_769"></a><a href="#Footnote_768_769" class="fnanchor">[768]</a> How uncomfortable was his
position at home is shown by a letter which he wrote to his friend
the Rev. Mr. Temple in September, 1775:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I came to Auchinleck on Monday last, and I have patiently lived at it till
Saturday evening.... It is hardly credible how difficult it is for a man of my sensibility
to support existence in the family where I now am. My father, whom I
really both respect and affectionate (if that is a word, for it is a different feeling from
that which is expressed by <em>love</em>, which I can say of you from my soul), is so different
from me. We <em>divaricate</em> so much, as Dr. Johnson said, that I am often hurt when,
I dare say, he means no harm: and he has a method of treating me which makes me
feel myself like a <em>timid boy</em>, which to <em>Boswell</em> (comprehending all that my character
does in my own imagination and in that of a wonderful number of mankind) is
intolerable. His wife too, whom in my conscience I cannot condemn for any
capital bad quality, is so narrow-minded, and, I don’t know how, so set upon keeping
him under her own management, and so suspicious and so sourishly tempered that
it requires the utmost exertion of practical philosophy to keep myself quiet. I however
have done so all this week to admiration: nay, I have appeared good-humoured;
but it has cost me drinking a considerable quantity of strong beer to dull my
faculties.”<a name="FNanchor_769_770" id="FNanchor_769_770"></a><a href="#Footnote_769_770" class="fnanchor">[769]</a></p></div>

<p>It can scarcely be doubted that he is describing the position
which he himself held at home, in an essay which he published in
the <cite>London Magazine</cite> in 1781 (p. 253):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I knew a father who was a violent Whig, and used to attack his son for being
a Tory, upbraiding him with being deficient in ‘noble sentiments of liberty,’ while
at the same time he made this son live under his roof in such bondage, that he was
not only afraid to stir from home without leave, like a child, but durst scarcely open<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_272" id="Page_272">{272}</a></span>
his mouth in his father’s presence. This was sad living. Yet I would rather see
such an excess of awe than a degree of familiarity between father and son by which
all reverence is destroyed.”</p></div>

<p>Lord Auchinleck had taken unto himself a second wife on the
very day of his son’s marriage. She was, in all likelihood, in the
house at the time of Johnson’s visit, but neither by him nor
Boswell is she once mentioned. She remained, no doubt, silent
and insignificant. With their reception they must have been
satisfied on the whole, as they prolonged their stay till the sixth
day, in spite of the famous altercation which Boswell’s piety forbade
him to record at any length. That only one such scene should
have occurred speaks well for the self-control both of host and
guest. To Boswell Johnson had quickly become attached. “Give
me your hand,” he said to him in the first weeks of their acquaintance,
“I have taken a liking to you.” A month or so later he
added, “There are few people to whom I take so much as to you.”
But Lord Auchinleck, though he might have respected he never
could have liked. No men were more unlike in everything but
personal appearance, than Boswell and his father. The old man
had none of that “facility of manners,” of which, according to Adam
Smith, the son “was happily possessed.”<a name="FNanchor_770_771" id="FNanchor_770_771"></a><a href="#Footnote_770_771" class="fnanchor">[770]</a> Whence he got it we
are nowhere told&mdash;perhaps from his mother. It certainly was not
from his paternal grandfather, the old advocate, “who was a slow,
dull man of unwearied perseverance and unmeasurable length in his
speeches. It was alleged he never understood a cause till he had
lost it thrice.”<a name="FNanchor_771_772" id="FNanchor_771_772"></a><a href="#Footnote_771_772" class="fnanchor">[771]</a> <span class="sidenote">BOSWELL’S DUTCH BLOOD.</span> There were those who attributed Boswell’s
eccentricities to his great grandmother, Veronica, Countess of
Kincardine, a Dutch lady of the noble house of Sommelsdyck.
“For this marriage,” writes Ramsay of Ochtertyre, “their posterity
paid dear, for most of them had peculiarities which they had better
have wanted.” He adds that “Boswell’s behaviour on the occasion
of the riots in Edinburgh about the Douglas cause, savoured so
much of insanity, that it was generally imputed to his Dutch
blood.”<a name="FNanchor_772_773" id="FNanchor_772_773"></a><a href="#Footnote_772_773" class="fnanchor">[772]</a> Why madness was supposed to come from Holland I
do not know. Sir William Temple, writing of that country, says:
“In general all appetites and passions seem to run lower and
cooler here than in other countries where I have conversed. Their
tempers are not airy enough for joy or any unusual strains of<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_273" id="Page_273">{273}</a></span>
pleasant humour, nor warm enough for love. This is talked of sometimes
among the younger men, but as a thing they have heard of rather
than felt; and as a discourse
that becomes them rather
than affects them.”<a name="FNanchor_773_774" id="FNanchor_773_774"></a><a href="#Footnote_773_774" class="fnanchor">[773]</a> All
this was the very reverse
of Boswell’s eager and wild
youth, though perhaps not
unlike the character
of his father and
grandfather. <span class="sidenote">AUCHINLECK LIBRARY.</span> There
was one thing in
common between
Johnson and the old
judge, both were
sound scholars. At
Auchinleck there
was a library “which,”
says Boswell, “incurious
editions of the Greek
and Roman classics is,
I suppose, not excelled
by any private collection
in Great Britain.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_274" id="Page_274">{274}</a></span></p>

<p>Here Johnson found an edition of Anacreon which he had long
sought in vain. “They had therefore much matter for conversation
without touching on the fatal topics of difference.” In all questions
of Church and State they were wide as the poles asunder. In
the perfect confidence which each man had in his own judgment
there was nothing to choose between them.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD AUCHINLECK.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My father,” writes Boswell, “was as sanguine a Whig and Presbyterian as Dr.
Johnson was a Tory and Church-of-England man: and as he had not much leisure
to be informed of Dr. Johnson’s great merits by reading his works, he had a partial
and unfavourable notion of him, founded on his supposed political tenets; which
were so discordant to his own, that instead of speaking of him with that respect to
which he was entitled, he used to call him ‘<em>a Jacobite fellow</em>.’ Knowing all this, I
should not have ventured to bring them together, had not my father, out of kindness
to me, desired me to invite Dr. Johnson to his house. I was very anxious that all
should be well; and begged of my friend to avoid three topics, as to which they
differed very widely; Whiggism, Presbyterianism, and&mdash;Sir John Pringle. He said
courteously, ‘I shall certainly not talk on subjects which I am told are disagreeable
to a gentleman under whose roof I am; especially, I shall not do so to <em>your father</em>.’”</p></div>

<p>Yet with all Lord Auchinleck’s gravity and contempt of his
son’s flightiness, he had known what it was not only to be young,
but to be foolish. Like so many of the young Scotchmen of old,
he had been sent to Holland to study civil law. Thence he had
made his way to Paris, where he had played the fop. Years afterwards
one of the companions of his youth, meeting his son at Lord
Kames’s table, “told him that he had seen his father strutting
abroad in red-heeled shoes and red stockings. The lad was so
much diverted with it that he could hardly sit on his chair for
laughing.”<a name="FNanchor_774_775" id="FNanchor_774_775"></a><a href="#Footnote_774_775" class="fnanchor">[774]</a> His appointment as judge he owed to that most
corrupt of Whig ministers, the Duke of Newcastle,<a name="FNanchor_775_776" id="FNanchor_775_776"></a><a href="#Footnote_775_776" class="fnanchor">[775]</a> and he was as
Whiggish as his patron. King William III., “one of the most
worthless scoundrels that ever existed,” according to Johnson, was
to him the greatest hero in modern times. Presbyterianism he
loved all the more because it was a cheap religion, and narrowed
the power of the clergy. He laid it down as a rule that a poor
clergy was ever a pure clergy. He added that in former times
they had timber communion cups and silver ministers, but now
we were getting silver cups and timber ministers.<a name="FNanchor_776_777" id="FNanchor_776_777"></a><a href="#Footnote_776_777" class="fnanchor">[776]</a> According
to Sir Walter Scott he carried “his Whiggery and Presbyterianism<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_275" id="Page_275">{275}</a></span>
to such a height, that once, when a countryman came in
to state some justice business, and being required to make his oath,
declined to do so before his lordship, because he was not a
<em>covenanted</em> magistrate&mdash;‘Is that a’ your objection, mon?’ said the
judge: ‘come your ways in here, and we’ll baith of us tak the
solemn league and covenant together.’ The oath was accordingly
agreed and sworn to by both, and I dare say it was the last time it
ever received such homage.”<a name="FNanchor_777_778" id="FNanchor_777_778"></a><a href="#Footnote_777_778" class="fnanchor">[777]</a> He would have nothing to do with
clearing his tongue of Scotticisms, or with smoothing and rounding
his periods on the model of the English classical authors. “His
Scotch was broad and vulgar.”<a name="FNanchor_778_779" id="FNanchor_778_779"></a><a href="#Footnote_778_779" class="fnanchor">[778]</a> In one thing at all events he was
sure of receiving Johnson’s warm approval. He was a great
planter of trees. “It was,” he said, “his favourite recreation. In
his vacations he used to prune with his own hands the trees which
he himself had planted. Beginning at five in the morning, he
wrought with his knife every spare hour. Of Auchinleck he was
passionately fond.”<a name="FNanchor_779_780" id="FNanchor_779_780"></a><a href="#Footnote_779_780" class="fnanchor">[779]</a> He was not the man to prefer Fleet Street
to the beauties of Nature. “I perceive some dawnings of taste for
the country,” wrote his son on one of his visits to his old home.
“I will force a taste for rural beauties.”<a name="FNanchor_780_781" id="FNanchor_780_781"></a><a href="#Footnote_780_781" class="fnanchor">[780]</a> He never succeeded
in the attempt, and though he often boasted of “walking among
the rocks and woods of his ancestors,” it was from a distance that
he most admired them.</p>

<p>Rarely were two men more unlike. The old man had in excess
that foresight which in Boswell was so largely wanting. He had
built himself a new house, which Johnson describes as “very magnificent
and very convenient;” but he had proceeded “so slowly
and prudently that he hardly felt the expense.”<a name="FNanchor_781_782" id="FNanchor_781_782"></a><a href="#Footnote_781_782" class="fnanchor">[781]</a> Across the front
of it he put the inscription&mdash;</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse indent8">“Quod petis hic est,</div>
<div class="verse">Est Ulubris, animus si te non deficit æquus.”<a name="FNanchor_782_783" id="FNanchor_782_783"></a><a href="#Footnote_782_783" class="fnanchor">[782]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is,” writes Boswell, “characteristic of the founder; but the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">animus æquus</i> is,
alas! not inheritable, nor the subject of devise. He always talked to me as if it
were in a man’s own power to attain it; but Dr. Johnson told me that he owned to
him, when they were alone, his persuasion that it was in a great measure constitutional,
or the effect of causes which do not depend on ourselves, and that Horace
boasts too much when he says, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">æquum mi animum ipse parabo</i>.”</p></div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_276" id="Page_276">{276}</a></span></p><div class="sidenote">JAMES BOSWELL.</div>

<p>He had, too, that sobriety of character in which his son was so
conspicuously wanting. “His age, his office, and his character,
had given him an acknowledged claim to great attention in whatever
company he was, and he could ill brook any diminution of
it.” He was by no means deficient in humour, and in this respect
father and son were alike. “He had a great many good stories,
which he told uncommonly well, and he was remarkable for
‘humour, <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">incolumi gravitate</i>,’ as Lord Monboddo used to characterize
it.”</p>

<p>The contrast between his dignity and gravity, and Boswell’s
bustling and most comical liveliness, must have been as amusing
as it was striking. His ignorance of his son’s genius, and the
contempt for him which he did not conceal, heightened the picture.
Johnson’s presence would have greatly added to the interest of
the scene, for Boswell must have constantly wavered between his
admiration of his idol and his awe of his father. A few years
later Miss Burney met Boswell at Streatham, and thus describes
him, no doubt with a good deal of exaggeration:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He spoke the Scotch accent strongly. He had an odd mock solemnity of
manner, that he had acquired imperceptibly from constantly thinking of and
imitating Dr. Johnson. There was something slouching in his gait and dress, that
wore an air, ridiculously enough, of purporting to personify the same model. His
clothes were always too large for him; his hair or wig was constantly in a state of
negligence; and he never for a moment sat still or upright upon a chair. When he
met with Dr. Johnson he commonly forbore even answering anything that was said,
or attending to anything that went forward, lest he should miss the smallest sound
from that voice to which he paid such exclusive homage. His eyes goggled with
eagerness; he leant his ear almost on the shoulder of the Doctor; and his mouth
dropt open to catch every syllable that might be uttered. The Doctor generally
treated him as a schoolboy, whom without the smallest ceremony he pardoned or
rebuked alternately.”<a name="FNanchor_783_784" id="FNanchor_783_784"></a><a href="#Footnote_783_784" class="fnanchor">[783]</a></p></div>

<p>It is probable that this description is heightened by Miss
Burney’s wounded vanity. Boswell had not read her <cite>Evelina</cite>, and
when he was reproached by Johnson with being a Brangton&mdash;one
of the characters in the novel&mdash;he did not know what was meant.
She was as careful in recording the conversation that was about
herself as Boswell was in recording Johnson’s. Her great hero
was herself. The voices to which she paid her homage were those
in which she was praised and flattered.</p>

<p>In another place she describes “the singularity of his comic-serious
face and manner.”<a name="FNanchor_784_785" id="FNanchor_784_785"></a><a href="#Footnote_784_785" class="fnanchor">[784]</a> He himself has more than once drawn<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_277" id="Page_277">{277}</a></span>
his own character. He was, he flattered himself, a citizen of the
world; one who in his travels never felt himself from home. In
that impudent <cite>Correspondence</cite> which he and his friend Andrew
Erskine published when they were still almost lads, he thus
describes himself:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The author of the <cite>Ode to Tragedy</cite> is a most excellent man; he is of an ancient
family in the west of Scotland, upon which he values himself not a little. At his
nativity there appeared omens of his future greatness. His parts are bright; and
his education has been good. He has travelled in post-chaises miles without
number. He is fond of seeing much of the world. He eats of every good dish,
especially apple-pie. He drinks old hock. He has a very fine temper. He is
somewhat of an humorist, and a little tinctured with pride. He has a good manly
countenance, and he owns himself to be amorous. He has infinite vivacity, yet is
observed at times to have a melancholy cast. He is rather fat than lean, rather
short than tall, rather young than old. His shoes are neatly made, and he never
wears spectacles.”<a name="FNanchor_785_786" id="FNanchor_785_786"></a><a href="#Footnote_785_786" class="fnanchor">[785]</a></p></div>

<p>We have a later description of him again by his own hand, as
he was at the time of his tour with Johnson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Think, then (he says), of a gentleman of ancient blood, the pride of which
was his predominant passion. He was then in his thirty-third year, and had been
about four years happily married. His inclination was to be a soldier; but his
father, a respectable judge, had pressed him into the profession of the law. He
had travelled a good deal, and seen many varieties of human life. He had thought
more than anybody supposed, and had a pretty good stock of general learning and
knowledge. He had all Dr. Johnson’s principles, with some degree of relaxation.
He had rather too little, than too much prudence; and, his imagination being
lively, he often said things of which the effect was very different from the intention.
He resembled sometimes</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">‘The best good man, with the worst natur’d muse.’”</div>
</div></div></div></div>

<p>Johnson celebrated his good humour and perpetual cheerfulness,
his acuteness, his gaiety of conversation, and civility of
manners. “He was,” he said, “the best travelling companion in
the world.” According to Burke, “his good nature was so natural
to him that he had no merit in possessing it. A man might as well
assume to himself merit in possessing an excellent constitution.”
Reynolds loved him so well that “he left him £200 in his will, to
be expended, if he thought proper, in the purchase of a picture at
the sale of his paintings, to be kept for his sake.”<a name="FNanchor_786_787" id="FNanchor_786_787"></a><a href="#Footnote_786_787" class="fnanchor">[786]</a> In a memoir
of him in the <cite>Scots Magazine</cite> he is described as “a most pleasant
companion, affectionate and friendly; but, particularly in his latter
days, he betrayed a vanity which seemed to predominate.”<a name="FNanchor_787_788" id="FNanchor_787_788"></a><a href="#Footnote_787_788" class="fnanchor">[787]</a> Tytler<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_278" id="Page_278">{278}</a></span>
praises “his sprightly fancy and whimsical eccentricity,” which
“agreeably tempered the graver conversation” of Adam Smith
or Hugh Blair at the small and select parties given by Lord
Kames.<a name="FNanchor_788_789" id="FNanchor_788_789"></a><a href="#Footnote_788_789" class="fnanchor">[788]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE COLLISION IN THE LIBRARY.</div>

<p>He was welcome everywhere but at his own father’s house.
Neither was he the better thought of by the old man on account
of the great Englishman whom he brought with him. Everything
however went off smoothly for a day or two, but the host and his
guest at length came in collision over Lord Auchinleck’s collection
of medals. The scene is thus described by Boswell, who witnessed
it:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Oliver Cromwell’s coin unfortunately introduced Charles the First and
Toryism. They became exceedingly warm and violent, and I was very much distressed
by being present at such an altercation between two men, both of whom I
reverenced; yet I durst not interfere. It would certainly be very unbecoming in
me to exhibit my honoured father and my respected friend, as intellectual gladiators,
for the entertainment of the public; and, therefore, I suppress what would, I dare
say, make an interesting scene in this dramatic sketch&mdash;this account of the transit
of Johnson over the Caledonian Hemisphere.”</p></div>

<p>Ramsay of Ochtertyre says, that the year after this famous
altercation, Lord Auchinleck “told him with warmth that the
great Dr. Johnson, of whom he had heard wonders, was just a
dominie, and the worst-bred dominie he had ever seen.”<a name="FNanchor_789_790" id="FNanchor_789_790"></a><a href="#Footnote_789_790" class="fnanchor">[789]</a> The
account which Sir Walter Scott gives is very dramatic, though no
doubt somewhat embellished.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Old Lord Auchinleck (he writes) was an able lawyer, a good scholar, after the
manner of Scotland, and highly valued his own advantages as a man of good estate
and ancient family; and, moreover, he was a strict Presbyterian and Whig of the
old Scottish cast. This did not prevent his being a terribly proud aristocrat; and
great was the contempt he entertained and expressed for his son James, for the
nature of his friendships and the character of the personages of whom he was <i lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">engoué</i>
one after another. ‘There’s nae hope for Jamie, mon,’ he said to a friend. ‘Jamie
is gaen clean gyte.<a name="FNanchor_790_791" id="FNanchor_790_791"></a><a href="#Footnote_790_791" class="fnanchor">[790]</a> What do you think, mon? He’s done wi’ Paoli&mdash;he’s off wi’
the land-louping<a name="FNanchor_791_792" id="FNanchor_791_792"></a><a href="#Footnote_791_792" class="fnanchor">[791]</a> scoundrel of a Corsican; and whose tail do you think he has
pinned himself to now, mon?’ Here the old judge summoned up a sneer of most
sovereign contempt. ‘A <em>dominie</em>, mon&mdash;an auld dominie: he keeped a schu&#774;le, and
cau’d it an acaadamy.”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">SCOTCH DOMINIES.</div>

<p>The full force of Lord Auchinleck’s contempt is only seen
when we understand the position of a <em>dominie</em>. The character of
a schoolmaster, generally, according to Johnson, was less honourable<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">{279}</a></span>
in Scotland than in England.<a name="FNanchor_792_793" id="FNanchor_792_793"></a><a href="#Footnote_792_793" class="fnanchor">[792]</a> But the dominie, or tutor in a
family, was still less esteemed. “He was raised,” writes Sir Walter
Scott, “from a humble class to a society where, whatever his personal
attainments might be, he found himself placed at a humiliating
distance from anything like a footing of equality. His remuneration
was scanty in the extreme, and consisting (as if to fill up the
measure of his dependence) not entirely of a fixed salary, but
partly of the precarious prospect of future preferment in the
Church. The Scotch <em>dominie</em> was assuredly one of the most
pitiable of human beings.”<a name="FNanchor_793_794" id="FNanchor_793_794"></a><a href="#Footnote_793_794" class="fnanchor">[793]</a> It is a curious and perhaps a somewhat
suspicious fact, that a very few years before Sir Walter
supplied Mr. Croker with this amusing story about the old judge,
he had put on record in the pages of the <cite>Quarterly Review</cite> the
following anecdote: “When the old Scots judge Lord Auchinleck
first heard of Johnson’s coming to visit him at his rural <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">castellum</i>,
he held up his hands in astonishment, and cried out, ‘Our Jeemy’s
clean aff the hooks now! would ony body believe it? he’s bringing
down a <em>dominie</em> wi’ him&mdash;an auld dominie.’”<a name="FNanchor_794_795" id="FNanchor_794_795"></a><a href="#Footnote_794_795" class="fnanchor">[794]</a> This looks like a
different version of the same story. Moreover, Boswell tells us
that his father had desired him to invite him to his house. When
Johnson called his school at Lichfield an academy, he does not
seem to have used the term pretentiously, for in his <cite>Dictionary</cite>
he defines the word under one of its meanings as “a place of
education in contradistinction to the universities or public schools.”
It does not seem likely, moreover, that Lord Auchinleck had any
feeling of contempt for Pascal Paoli, a man of good family, who for
years had headed a rebellion against the tyranny first of Genoa
and afterwards of France. He had visited Auchinleck two years
before Johnson, and had been well received. Boswell, writing to
Garrick on September 18, 1771, said: “I have just been enjoying
the very great happiness of a visit from my illustrious friend,
Pascal Paoli. He was two nights at Auchinleck, and you may
figure the joy of my worthy father and me at seeing the Corsican
hero in our romantic groves. Count Burgynski, the Polish
ambassador, accompanied him.”<a name="FNanchor_795_796" id="FNanchor_795_796"></a><a href="#Footnote_795_796" class="fnanchor">[795]</a> Poland’s days of sending ambassadors
had nearly drawn to an end, for the first partition of the
country was made in the following year. It was a strange chance
which brought the last Corsican patriot and the last Polish ambassador<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">{280}</a></span>
to this Ayrshire mansion. One thing only was wanting.
Would that Burns that day had played truant and had wandered
up “Lugar’s winding stream” as far as Auchinleck! It would,
indeed, have formed an interesting group&mdash;the stiff old Scotch
judge and his famous son, the great Corsican patriot and the Pole,
with the peasant-lad gazing at them with his eyes full of beauty
and wonder. Paoli’s name is well-nigh forgotten now, but he and
his Corsicans deeply stirred the hearts of our forefathers. Boswell,
by a private subscription in Scotland, had sent out to him in one
week £700 worth of ordnance&mdash;“a tolerable train of artillery.”<a name="FNanchor_796_797" id="FNanchor_796_797"></a><a href="#Footnote_796_797" class="fnanchor">[796]</a>
His account of his tour in that island had been widely read. Even
his father “was rather fond of it. ‘James,’ he said, ‘had taken a
<em>tout</em> on a new horn.’”<a name="FNanchor_797_798" id="FNanchor_797_798"></a><a href="#Footnote_797_798" class="fnanchor">[797]</a> Whether Lord Auchinleck abused Paoli
“as a land-louping scoundrel of a Corsican,” or admired him as he
admired other great patriots, the rest of Sir Walter Scott’s account
of the great altercation may be true enough:</p>

<div class="sidenote">THE “LITH” IN THE NECKS OF KINGS.</div>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The controversy between Tory and Covenanter raged with great fury, and
ended in Johnson’s pressing upon the old judge the question, what good Cromwell,
of whom he had said something derogatory, had ever done to his country; when,
after being much tortured, Lord Auchinleck at last spoke out, ‘God, Doctor! he
gart kings ken that they had a <em>lith</em> in their neck’&mdash;he taught kings they had a <em>joint</em>
in their necks.”</p></div>

<p>This story did not, I believe, appear in print till the year 1831,
when it was given as a note by Scott in Mr. Croker’s edition of
<cite>Boswell</cite>. Fifty years earlier it had been told in somewhat different
words of Quin the player, who had said that “on a thirtieth of
January every king in Europe would rise with a crick in his neck.”
Davies, who records the anecdote, says that it had been attributed
to Voltaire, but unjustly.<a name="FNanchor_798_799" id="FNanchor_798_799"></a><a href="#Footnote_798_799" class="fnanchor">[798]</a> It is possible, and even not unlikely,
that we have but a Scotch version of an English saying. Cromwell
himself, in his letter to the governor of Edinburgh Castle, had
shown that he too saw this consequence of his great deed. “The
civil authority,” he writes, “turned out a Tyrant in a way which
the Christians in aftertimes will mention with honour, and all
Tyrants in the world look at with fear.”<a name="FNanchor_799_800" id="FNanchor_799_800"></a><a href="#Footnote_799_800" class="fnanchor">[799]</a></p>

<p>In one happy though impudent retort, Lord Auchinleck was
very successful.</p>

<div class="sidenote">DURHAM ON THE GALATIANS.</div>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">{281}</a></span></p><div class="blockquot">

<p>“Dr. Johnson challenged him (writes Boswell) to point out any theological
works of merit written by Presbyterian ministers in Scotland. My father, whose
studies did not lie much in that way, owned to me afterwards, that he was somewhat
at a loss how to answer, but that luckily he recollected having read in catalogues
the title of <cite>Durham on the Galatians</cite>; upon which he boldly said, ‘Pray,
Sir, have your read Mr. Durham’s excellent commentary on the Galatians?’ ‘No,
Sir,’ said Dr. Johnson. By this lucky thought my father kept him at bay, and for
some time enjoyed his triumph; but his antagonist soon made a retort, which I forbear
to mention.”</p></div>

<p>In the long list of Durham’s theological works in the British
Museum catalogue I find no mention of this book on the Galatians.
The old judge, it is clear, had not forgotten in the years which he
had sat on the bench the arts of the advocate. In Rowlandson’s
Caricatures there is a humorous picture of <cite>The Contest at Auchinleck</cite>.
Johnson is drawn felling his opponent with a huge liturgy,
having made him drop two books equally big, entitled <em>Calvin</em> and
<em>Whiggism</em>. On the floor are lying the medals over which the dispute
had begun, while Boswell is at the door in an attitude of
despair, with his <cite>Journal</cite> falling from his hands.</p>

<p>One figure was wanting to make the picture complete. Of the
three topics on which Johnson had been warned not to touch only
two had been introduced. “In the course of their altercation,”
writes Boswell, “Whiggism and Presbyterianism, Toryism and
Episcopacy, were terribly buffeted. My worthy hereditary friend,
Sir John Pringle, never having been mentioned, happily escaped
without a bruise.” We could have wished that he had been mentioned,
for though we know of the dislike which existed between
the two men, yet as he has never “hitched” in one of Johnson’s
strong sayings, he has scarcely attained that fame which he
deserved.</p>

<p>Towards Lord Auchinleck Johnson bore no resentment. With
him the heat of altercation soon passed away, but not the memory
of the hospitality which he had received in his house. In not a
single word spoken or written has he attacked him. On the contrary,
in his <cite>Journey to the Western Islands</cite>, he only mentions him
to praise him. When, six years later, he published the first four
volumes of his <cite>Lives of the Poets</cite>, he wrote to Boswell: “Write me
word to whom I shall send sets of <cite>Lives</cite>; would it please Lord
Auchinleck?” A few months after this he wrote to him: “Let
me know what reception you have from your father, and the state
of his health. Please him as much as you can, and add no pain to
his last years.” The old lord was not so placable. He had that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_282" id="Page_282">{282}</a></span>
“want of tenderness which,” said Johnson, “is want of parts.”
This part of his character is seen in the following anecdote recorded
of him by his son:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I mentioned to Johnson a respectable person of a very strong mind, who had
little of that tenderness which is common to human nature; as an instance of which,
when I suggested to him that he should invite his son, who had been settled ten
years in foreign parts, to come home and pay him a visit, his answer was, ‘No, no,
let him mind his business.’ <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span> ‘I do not agree with him, Sir, in this.
Getting money is not all a man’s business: to cultivate kindness is a valuable part
of the business of life.’”</p></div>

<div class="sidenote">LORD AUCHINLECK’S RESENTMENT.</div>

<p>He had what Boswell calls “the dignified courtesy of an old
Baron,” and when Johnson left “was very civil to him, and
politely attended him to his post-chaise.” But he was not in the
least soothed by the compliments which he paid him in his book.
Boswell had hoped that he might be moved. Writing to Johnson
just after it had been published, he said: “You have done Auchinleck
much honour, and have, I hope, overcome my father, who has
never forgiven your warmth for monarchy and episcopacy. I am
anxious to see how your pages will operate upon him.”<a name="FNanchor_800_801" id="FNanchor_800_801"></a><a href="#Footnote_800_801" class="fnanchor">[800]</a> His
anxious wish was grievously disappointed. A few months later he
wrote to his friend Temple: “My father is most unhappily dissatisfied
with me.... He harps on my going over Scotland with
a brute (think how shockingly erroneous!) and wandering (or some
such phrase) to London. How hard it is that I am totally excluded
from parental comfort! I have a mind to go to Auchinleck
next autumn, and try what living in a mixed stupidity of attention
to common objects and restraint from expressing any of my own
feelings can do with him.”<a name="FNanchor_801_802" id="FNanchor_801_802"></a><a href="#Footnote_801_802" class="fnanchor">[801]</a> When his father and Johnson were
both dead he indulged in the pious hope that “as they were both
worthy Christian men, they had met in happiness. But I must
observe,” he adds, “in justice to my friend’s political principles and
my own, that they have met in a place where there is no room for
<em>Whiggism</em>.” Johnson, it is true, “always said the first Whig was
the Devil,” but on the other hand, some Presbyterian who drew up
an epitaph on Lochiel, declared in it that he “is now a Whig in
heaven.”<a name="FNanchor_802_803" id="FNanchor_802_803"></a><a href="#Footnote_802_803" class="fnanchor">[802]</a></p>

<p>That pride in his ancient blood, which Boswell boasted was his
predominant passion, was very strong in the old lord. In the son,
if it really existed in any strength, it was happily overpowered by<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_283" id="Page_283">{283}</a></span>
a host of other and better feelings. He had travelled widely, he
had seen a great variety of men, some of them among the most
famous of their age, and had learnt to value genius without
troubling himself about its pedigree. His successors at Auchinleck
had something of the narrowness of the old judge. <span class="sidenote">SIR ALEXANDER BOSWELL.</span> “His eldest
son, Sir Alexander Boswell,” wrote Sir Walter Scott, “was a
proud man, and like his grandfather, thought that his father
lowered himself by his deferential suit and service to Johnson. I
have observed he disliked any allusion to the book or to Johnson
himself, and I have heard that Johnson’s fine picture by Sir Joshua
was sent upstairs out of the sitting apartments.”<a name="FNanchor_803_804" id="FNanchor_803_804"></a><a href="#Footnote_803_804" class="fnanchor">[803]</a> He was not too
proud a man to write a poem on the anniversary of the Accession
of George IV., and what is George IV. now? It was not from
any dulness of mind that he did not value his father’s book. “He
had,” says Lockhart, “all <em>Bozzy’s</em> cleverness, good-humour, and
joviality, without one touch of his meaner qualities, wrote some
popular songs, which he sang capitally, and was moreover a
thorough bibliomaniac.”<a name="FNanchor_804_805" id="FNanchor_804_805"></a><a href="#Footnote_804_805" class="fnanchor">[804]</a> It was due to him and a friend, that the
Burns monument at Ayr was erected. They summoned a public
meeting, but no one attended except themselves. Little daunted
they appointed a chairman, proposed resolutions, carried them
unanimously, passed a vote of thanks, and issued subscription
lists. More than £2,000 was subscribed, and the monument was
opened by Sir Alexander shortly before his death. That he was
not wanting in tenderness of heart is shown by some of his poems.
How pretty is the following verse in an address by an aged father
to his children:&mdash;</p>

</div></div></div>

<p>Lockhart goes, however, too far when he exalts him in comparison
with his father. Boswell, I feel sure, would never have been
guilty of the act which involved his son in the unhappy duel in
which he lost his life. In two scurrilous newspapers he had<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">{284}</a></span>
secretly defamed his kinsman, Mr. James Stuart, of Dunearn,
“with whom he had long been on good terms.” Though the
articles were written in a disguised hand, the authorship was
detected. He received a challenge from the injured man, and at
the first shot fell mortally wounded. He dined with Scott a day
or two before the duel, and “though Charles Matthews (the
famous comedian) was present, poor Sir Alexander Boswell’s
songs, jokes, and anecdotes exhibited no symptom of eclipse.”<a name="FNanchor_806_807" id="FNanchor_806_807"></a><a href="#Footnote_806_807" class="fnanchor">[806]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">SIR JAMES BOSWELL.</div>

<p>His only son, Sir James Boswell, the last male descendant of
the author of the immortal <cite>Life</cite>, shared his father’s illiberal feelings
about Johnson. Miss Macleod of Macleod told me that when
she was on a visit at Auchinleck, he said to her one day that he
did not know how he should name one of his race-horses. She
suggested Boswell’s Johnsoniana, which made him very angry.
He was, I learnt, a man of great natural ability, who, had he
chosen, might have become distinguished. His feeling of soreness
against his grandfather was partly due to another cause than dislike
of hero-worship. Boswell, in an access of that particular kind
of folly which he called “feudal enthusiasm,” had entailed his
estates on the heirs male of his father to the exclusion of his own
nearer female descendants. Sir James, who had no sons, saw that
Auchinleck on his death would pass away from his daughters to his
cousin, Thomas Alexander Boswell, Lord Auchinleck’s grandson
by his second son David. He managed to get the settlement
upset on the plea that in the deed the first five letters of the word
<em>irredeemably</em> were written upon an erasure.<a name="FNanchor_807_808" id="FNanchor_807_808"></a><a href="#Footnote_807_808" class="fnanchor">[807]</a> It is not impossible
that the lawyer who drew it up, not liking the provision, intentionally
contrived this loop-hole.</p>

<p>Among Boswell’s male descendants, his second son James was,
so far as I know, the only one who was not ashamed of the <cite>Life of
Johnson</cite>. He supplied notes to the later editions. His father,
writing of him when he was eleven years old, says: “My second
son is an extraordinary boy; he is much of his father (vanity of
vanities).”<a name="FNanchor_808_809" id="FNanchor_808_809"></a><a href="#Footnote_808_809" class="fnanchor">[808]</a> Croker describes him as “very convivial, and in
other respects like his father&mdash;though altogether on a smaller
scale.”<a name="FNanchor_809_810" id="FNanchor_809_810"></a><a href="#Footnote_809_810" class="fnanchor">[809]</a> According to Lockhart, he was “a man of considerable
learning and admirable social qualities. To him Sir Walter Scott<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">{285}</a></span>
was warmly attached. He died suddenly in the prime of life,
about a fortnight before his brother.”<a name="FNanchor_810_811" id="FNanchor_810_811"></a><a href="#Footnote_810_811" class="fnanchor">[810]</a></p>

<p>When Boswell, at the age of twenty-seven, published his
<cite>Account of Corsica</cite>, he boasted in his preface that “he cherished
the hope of being remembered after death, which has been a great
object to the noblest minds in all ages.” When he saw his <cite>Life
of Johnson</cite> reach its second edition, he said with a frankness which
is almost touching, “I confess that I am so formed by nature and
by habit, that to restrain the effusion of delight on having obtained
such fame, to me would be truly painful. Why then should I
suppress it? Why ‘out of the abundance of the heart’ should I
not speak?” He goes on to mention the spontaneous praise
which he has received from eminent persons, “much of which,” he
adds, “I have under their hands to be reposited in my archives at
Auchinleck.” How little did he foresee that his executors, with a
brutish ignorance worthy of perpetual execration, would destroy
his manuscripts! If Oliver Goldsmith had had children and grand-children,
they too, when they read of his envy and his vanity,
when they were told that “in conversation he was an empty, noisy,
blundering rattle,”<a name="FNanchor_811_812" id="FNanchor_811_812"></a><a href="#Footnote_811_812" class="fnanchor">[811]</a> might have blushed to own that they were
sprung from the author of <cite>The Deserted Village</cite> and <cite>The Vicar of
Wakefield</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOSWELL’S DESCENDANTS.</div>

<p>It is a melancholy thing that Boswell’s descendants should have
seen their famous ancestor’s faults so clearly as to have been
unable to enjoy that pride which was so justly their due, in being
sprung from a man of such real, if curious genius. Was it nothing
to have written the best biography which the world has ever seen?
Nothing to have increased more than any writer of his generation
“the public stock of harmless pleasure?” Nothing to have “exhibited”
with the greatest skill “a view of literature and literary
men in Great Britain for near half a century?” Nothing to have
been the delight of men of the greatest and most varied genius?
Nothing to be read wherever the English tongue is spoken, and,
as seems likely, as long as the English tongue shall last? <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Sume
superbiam quæsitam meritis</i>, “Assume the honours justly thine,”
we would say to each one of his race.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOSWELL’S FAME.</div>

<p>How widely Boswell’s influence is felt is shown in a story
which was told me by Sir Charles Sikes, the benevolent inventor<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_286" id="Page_286">{286}</a></span>
of the Post Office Savings Banks, and no mean Johnsonian. One
day he had gone under an archway in Fleet Street to shun a
shower, as Burke might have gone.<a name="FNanchor_812_813" id="FNanchor_812_813"></a><a href="#Footnote_812_813" class="fnanchor">[812]</a> Being “knowing and conversible,”
he fell into talk with a sergeant of police who was also
taking shelter, and whose tongue showed that he was an Irishman.
He came, he said, from the west of Ireland. When he was a boy
the parish priest had lent him a copy of the <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>. He
had read it again and again, till at last the wish grew so strong
upon him to see with his own eyes the scenes which in the pages
of the book were so familiar to him, that he came to London, not
knowing what employment he should find, but bent on seeing
Fleet Street. What pilgrimages have not men made from the
other side of the Atlantic to the same spots! With their Boswell
in their hands they have wandered by Charing Cross, “with its
full tide of human existence;” up the Strand, “through the greatest
series of shops in the world;” under Temple Bar, where Johnson’s
and Goldsmith’s names did <em>not</em> mingle with those of the Scotch
rebels<a name="FNanchor_813_814" id="FNanchor_813_814"></a><a href="#Footnote_813_814" class="fnanchor">[813]</a>; along Fleet Street, with “its very animated appearance,”
to the courts and lanes and taverns where the spirits of the men
who gathered round the great Lexicographer seem still to linger.
The Boswells are proud of their descent from a man who fell at
Flodden Field. There are thousands and ten thousands of Scotchmen
who got knocked on their heads in border forays, but only one
who wrote the <cite>Life of Johnson</cite>. “The chief glory of every people
arises from its authors,” and among Scotch authors Sir Walter
Scott alone equals Boswell in the extent of his popularity. The
genius of Burns lies hidden from most Englishmen in the dialect
in which his finest poetry is written. Never did one man of letters
do another a more shameful wrong than when Macaulay laboured
at the ridiculous paradox that the first of biographers was “a man
of the meanest and feeblest intellect.” He was thirty years old
when he wrote this. Yet, to borrow Johnson’s words, it was such
stuff as a young man talks when he first begins to think himself a
clever fellow, and he ought to have been whipped for it. The<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_287" id="Page_287">{287}</a></span>
worst of it is that Macaulay, like Rousseau, talked his nonsense
so well that it still passes for gospel with all those who have
advanced as far as reading, but have not as yet attained to thinking.
We may feel thankful that he did not with his overpowering common
sense go on to overwhelm the memory of Goldsmith.</p>

<p>In the price set on autographs we have a means of measuring
in some fashion the estimation in which men are held by posterity.
The standard is but a rough one, however, for it is affected by the
number of their writings which chance to have been preserved:
judging by it, Boswell’s rank is very high. There were, probably,
few men whose career he more envied than that of Lord Bute’s
“errand-goer,” Alexander Wedderburne, who rose to be Lord
Loughborough, Earl of Rosslyn and Lord High Chancellor of
England. Yet a letter of his I have recently seen offered for sale
at ten shillings and sixpence, while Boswell’s was marked nine
guineas. While I exult at seeing that one author equals eighteen
Lord Chancellors, I sometimes sigh over the high prices which
have hitherto kept me from obtaining a specimen of the handwriting
of a man at whose works I have so long laboured.</p>

<p>It is to be hoped that the day will at length come when those
in whose veins Boswell’s blood still flows will take that just and
reasonable view of their famous forefather which will lead them,
from time to time, to throw open “the rocks and woods,” and even
“the stately house” of Auchinleck to strangers from afar. It was
he who “Johnsonised the land,” and they therefore should have
some indulgence for the enthusiasm which he created. “The
sullen dignity of the castle with which Johnson was delighted”
they should not keep altogether to themselves. Another famous
man had beheld those ruins also. “Since Paoli stood upon our
old castle,” wrote Boswell to a friend, “it has an additional dignity.”
Who would not like to stand upon it also, and to see the Lugar
running beneath, “bordered by high rocks shaded with wood?”
Into this beautiful stream falls “a pleasing brook,” to use Johnson’s
odd description of a rivulet which has cut a deep passage through
the sandstone. “It runs,” he adds, “by a red rock, out of which
has been hewn a very agreeable and commodious summer-house.”
I have been told that the meeting of the waters is a scene of
striking beauty. Then there are “the venerable old trees under
the shade of which,” writes Boswell, “my ancestors had walked,”
and the groves where, as he told Johnson, it was his intention to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">{288}</a></span>
erect a monument to his “reverend friend.” “Sir,” he answered,
little flattered by the prospect of “a lapidary inscription,” “I hope
to see your grand-children.” Who would not gladly stroll along
Lord Auchinleck’s <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">via sacra</i>, “that road which he made to the
church, for above three miles, on his own estate, through a range
of well-inclosed farms, with a row of trees on each side of it?”
The avenue is composed mainly of oaks and beeches, planted
alternately; but the finest of the trees were brought down a few
years ago in a great storm which swept over the country. Only
one or two small farms remain, but there are the ruins of another.
From the road a most pleasant view is seen, grassy slopes running
down to the Lugar, with hedge-rows and trees growing in them
after the English fashion. Across the river the ground rises rapidly
in tilled fields and meadows and groves to a high range of hills.
To the south-west lies the village of Ochiltree, whence Scott
perhaps derived old Edie’s name in the <cite>Antiquary</cite>.</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUCHINLECK MANSE.</div>

<p>The manse still stands where Johnson dined with the Rev.
John Dun, who had been Boswell’s <em>dominie</em>, and had been rewarded
for his services by the presentation to the living of
Auchinleck. He rashly attacked before his guest the Church of
England, and “talked of fat bishops and drowsy deans. Dr.
Johnson was so highly offended, that he said to him, ‘Sir, you
know no more of our church than a Hottentot.’” Dun must have
complained to Boswell of being thus publicly likened to the proverbial
Hottentot, for in the second edition of the <cite>Tour to the
Hebrides</cite> his name is suppressed. The manse has been enlarged
since those days, and surrounded with a delightful garden which
might excite the envy, if not of a drowsy dean, at all events of
a south country vicar. In the venerable minister, Dr. James
Chrystal, who has lived there for more than fifty years, Johnson
would have found a man “whom, if he should have quarrelled with
him, he would have found the most difficulty how to abuse.”</p>

<div class="sidenote">AUCHINLECK CHURCHYARD.</div>

<p>The parish church where Johnson refused to attend Boswell
and his father at public worship has been rebuilt. In the churchyard
stands a fine old beech which might have been called venerable
even a hundred years ago. There, too, is the vault of the Boswells
with their coat-of-arms engraved on it, and their motto, <em>Vraye Foy</em>.
In a niche cut in the solid rock lies Boswell’s body. He died in
London, at his house in Great Portland Street, but in accordance
with the direction in his will he was buried “in the family burial-place<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">{289}</a></span>
in the church of Auchinleck.” Though the vault is now at a
little distance from the church, yet in the old building, which did
not occupy precisely the same site, it was under a room at the back
of the Boswells’ pew. On a wall in the churchyard I noticed a
curiously-carved stone with the following inscription:</p>

</p>

<p>“Auchinleck,” said the landlady of my inn, “is the very heart
of the Covenanters’ district.” Hard by, at Airdsmoss, the founder
of the Cameronians, with seven or eight of his followers, was slain in
July, 1681. In the churchyard lies buried a man of a very different
type of character&mdash;William Murdoch, the inventor of gas. Two of
Boswell’s tenants were James and William Murdoch. They and
their forefathers had possessed their farms for many generations.<a name="FNanchor_814_815" id="FNanchor_814_815"></a><a href="#Footnote_814_815" class="fnanchor">[814]</a>
Perhaps not only the <cite>Life of Boswell</cite>, but illumination by gas takes
its rise from Auchinleck.</p>

<p>The village consists mainly of one long street of solidly-built
stone houses; the older ones thatched and often white-washed, the
modern ones slated. At the back are good gardens well stocked
with fruit trees. Bare feet are far more common here than in the
Highlands or Hebrides. All the children, with scarcely an exception,
and many of the women, go bare-footed. As I passed down
the street a “roup,” or sale by auction, was going on before
the house of a deceased “baker, violin-maker, clock-mender, blood-letter,
dentist, geologist, and collector of coins.” The auctioneer,
standing on the doorstep of this departed worthy, who at one and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">{290}</a></span>
the same time had played many parts, dispersed his motley goods
to the four quarters of heaven. The best of his violins, for he had
had some of considerable value, had been sent for sale to Glasgow.
I stayed in the Railway Hotel, a curious old house, which
boasted of two sitting-rooms and one bed-room. It was clean and
comfortable, and in my courteous landlady I found a woman of
sense and education. She quoted <cite>Sartor Resartus</cite>, and spoke with
anger of Mr. Froude’s <cite>Life of Carlyle</cite>. In Scotland the traveller
finds book-learning far more generally diffused than in England.</p>

<p>In Boswell’s time Auchinleck, he tells us, was pronounced
Affléck. His grand-daughter, who died in 1836, informed Mr.
Croker that in her time it had come to be pronounced as it is
written. I learnt however from Dr. Chrystal that “the name
Affléck is still quite common as applied to the parish, and even
Auchinleck House is as often called Place Affléck as otherwise.”
A lad whom I questioned on the subject told me that the old people
call it Affléck but the young Auchinleck. The old pronunciation
will no doubt soon disappear.</p>

<div class="sidenote">BOSWELL AS A LANDLORD.</div>

<p>Boswell had been a kind landlord. Johnson, in the early days
of their acquaintance, “had recommended to him a liberal kindness
to his tenantry, as people over whom the proprietor was placed by
Providence.” The advice was congenial to his natural disposition.
In his will, which he made ten years before his death, he says: “As
there are upon the estate of Auchinleck several tenants whose
families have possessed their farms for many generations, I do by
these presents grant leases for nineteen years and their respective
lives to”&mdash;here follow the names of eight tenants. He continues:&mdash;“And
I do beseech all the succeeding heirs of entail to be kind to
the tenants, and not to turn out old possessors to get a little more
rent.” We may venture to express a hope that his descendants, if
they have slighted him as an author, have always honoured and followed
him as a landlord.</p>

<div class="sidenote">FROM AUCHINLECK TO EDINBURGH.</div>

<p>Leaving Auchinleck on the morning of November 8, our
travellers arrived that night at Hamilton on the road to Edinburgh.
They had crossed Drumclog Moor, the scene of the skirmish nearly<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">{291}</a></span>
one hundred years earlier where Claverhouse was beaten by the
Covenanters. Scott in <cite>Old Mortality</cite> has told how in the fight
John Balfour of Burley struck down Sergeant Bothwell. Fifty
years or so after our travellers crossed the Moor, Thomas Carlyle
and Edward Irving passed over it on foot. “It was here,” says
Carlyle, “as the sun was sinking, Irving drew from me by degrees,
in the softest manner, the confession that I did not think as he of
the Christian religion, and that it
was vain for me to expect I ever
could or should.”<a name="FNanchor_815_816" id="FNanchor_815_816"></a><a href="#Footnote_815_816" class="fnanchor">[815]</a> Boswell’s record
of this day’s journey is of the briefest.
“We came at night to a good inn
at Hamilton. I recollect no more.”
A writer in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite>
gives us a humorous description of
the innkeeper. “Hamilton Arms,
kept by Burns, tolerable. The landlord
from pure insipidity will laugh at

little town the highest praise in his vocabulary, by calling it “one of
the neatest he had seen in any country.”<a name="FNanchor_817_818" id="FNanchor_817_818"></a><a href="#Footnote_817_818" class="fnanchor">[817]</a> Whatever nature could do,
the force of art could no farther go last century than make a place
neat. Boswell, before they left next morning, in vain tried to move<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_292" id="Page_292">{292}</a></span>
Johnson to visit the Palace of Hamilton, as the Duke’s castle is called.
“He had not come to Scotland to see fine places of which there were
enough in England.” He would do nothing more than view the
outside. <span class="sidenote">RETURN TO EDINBURGH.</span> That same night “they arrived at Edinburgh after an
absence of eighty-three days. For five weeks together of the tempestuous
season,” adds Boswell, “there had been no account
received of us.” Yet, as the crow flies, they had never at their
farthest been two hundred miles away. How vast is the
change since those days! I received the other day at my
house in Oxford, a letter which had been posted in Bombay just
fifteen days before. Johnson would have hurried on to London
had he followed his own wishes. “I long to come under your
care,” he wrote to Mrs. Thrale a day or two after his arrival
in Edinburgh, “but for some days cannot decently get away.” He
had his morning levees to hold, and his dinner and supper parties
to attend. “‘Sir,’ he said one evening, ‘we have been harassed by
invitations.’ I acquiesced. ‘Ay, sir,’ he replied, ‘but how much
worse would it have been if we had been neglected!’” There was
one man who did not harass him. Boswell nowhere mentions
that he visited Lord Auchinleck at his house in Parliament
Close.</p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD HAILES.</div>

<p>He paid a visit to New Hailes, four miles east of Edinburgh,
the seat of Sir David Dalrymple, better known by the title of Lord
Hailes, which he bore as one of the judges of Scotland. “Here,”
says Boswell, “we passed a most agreeable day, but,” he adds,
“again I must lament that I was so indolent as to let almost all that
passed evaporate into oblivion.” Johnson had first heard of his
host ten years earlier. One evening, when he and Boswell were
supping in a private room at the Turk’s Head Coffee-house in the
Strand, “he drank a bumper to Sir David Dalrymple as ‘a man of
worth, a scholar, and a wit. I have,’ said he, ‘never heard of him,
except from you; but let him know my opinion of him; for, as
he does not show himself much in the world, he should have the
praise of the few who hear of him.’” They did not meet till
Johnson came to Edinburgh, but then they at once took to each
other. “I love him better than any man whom I know so little,”
wrote Johnson eighteen months later. His love was no doubt increased
by the decision which his friend gave a few years later in
that famous case in which it was decided, by a majority of the
judges, that a slave who had been brought from Jamaica to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">{293}</a></span>
Scotland became thereby free. “Dear Lord Hailes was on the
side of liberty,” Johnson wrote to Boswell.<a name="FNanchor_818_819" id="FNanchor_818_819"></a><a href="#Footnote_818_819" class="fnanchor">[818]</a> He would have loved
him still more for the tenderness of heart which, unlike so many of
his brethren, he showed on the Bench. “When called to pass
sentence of death he addressed the unfortunate convicts in a
pathetic, dignified strain of piety and commiseration that made
a deep impression on the audience.”<a name="FNanchor_819_820" id="FNanchor_819_820"></a><a href="#Footnote_819_820" class="fnanchor">[819]</a> Many of the old judges, as is
shown by the stories recorded of them, were in criminal trials little
better than ruffians in ermine. If “robes and furred gowns hide
all,” in many a case they had far more cruelty to cover than the unfortunate
prisoner had been guilty of who was sent to the gallows.
Lord Hailes, with all his kindness, was by no means faultless as a
judge. He too often allowed his pedantry to override his good
sense. This failing in his friend, Boswell took off in his comic poem
<cite>The Court of Session Garland</cite>:</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“‘This cause,’ cries Hailes, ‘to judge I can’t pretend,</div>
<div class="verse">For <em>justice</em>, I perceive, wants an <em>e</em> at the end.’”</div>
</div></div></div>

<p>According to Dr. Robert Chambers “a story was told of his once
making a serious objection to a law-paper, and in consequence
to the whole suit, on account of the word <em>justice</em> being thus spelt.”<a name="FNanchor_820_821" id="FNanchor_820_821"></a><a href="#Footnote_820_821" class="fnanchor">[820]</a>
Lord Braxfield, one of the ruffian judges, but a man of strong mind,
“hearing him praised as a good judge, said, in his vulgar way,
‘Him! he knows nothing but the nooks of a cause.’ He was not
without his crotchets. One day when he sat as President, he
reprimanded a lawyer very sharply for making a ludicrous application
of some text in the Gospels or Epistles. ‘Sir,’ said he, ‘you
may take liberties with the Old Testament, but I will not suffer you
to meddle with the New.’”<a name="FNanchor_821_822" id="FNanchor_821_822"></a><a href="#Footnote_821_822" class="fnanchor">[821]</a></p>

<p>As an historian he had considerable merits. Johnson revised
the proof-sheets of his <cite>Annals of Scotland</cite>, and found them “a new
mode of history in our language.” “They are very exact,” he
added, “but they contain mere dry particulars. They are to be
considered as a Dictionary. You know such things are there, and
may be looked at when you please.”<a name="FNanchor_822_823" id="FNanchor_822_823"></a><a href="#Footnote_822_823" class="fnanchor">[822]</a> Gibbon praised him as “a
diligent collector, and an accurate critic;” but he complained that
when he came to criticise “the two invidious chapters” in the
<cite>Decline and Fall</cite>, “he scrutinized each separate passage with the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_294" id="Page_294">{294}</a></span>
dry minuteness of a special pleader; and as he was always solicitous
to make, he may have succeeded sometimes in finding a flaw.”<a name="FNanchor_823_824" id="FNanchor_823_824"></a><a href="#Footnote_823_824" class="fnanchor">[823]</a>
Hume spoke of him with contempt. “He is a godly man; feareth
the Lord and escheweth evil, and works out his salvation with fear
and trembling. None of the books he publishes are of his writing;
they are all historical manuscripts, of little or no consequence.”<a name="FNanchor_824_825" id="FNanchor_824_825"></a><a href="#Footnote_824_825" class="fnanchor">[824]</a>
“Nothing delighted him more,” writes Ramsay of Ochtertyre,
“than to demolish some historical fabric which length of time had
rendered venerable. I lent an old lady the first volume of his
<cite>Annals</cite>. She was so ill-pleased with the rejection of some popular
stories of Wallace, that she said she would drive the powder out of
his lordship’s wig if she were by him.”<a name="FNanchor_825_826" id="FNanchor_825_826"></a><a href="#Footnote_825_826" class="fnanchor">[825]</a> With all his critical power
he was a believer in Ossian. Burke, who once met him at dinner,
“found him a clever man, and generally knowing.”<a name="FNanchor_826_827" id="FNanchor_826_827"></a><a href="#Footnote_826_827" class="fnanchor">[826]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD HAILES AND DR. HALLAM.</div>

<p>He had been educated at Eton, and there one day had noticed a
little black-looking boy, who had come up “<em>to show for college</em>, <abbr title="id est">i.e.</abbr>,
to stand for a scholarship on the foundation.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After being examined he was found entitled to be placed high in the fourth
form, if he could make a copy of Latin verses in a given time. As he knew nothing
of the matter, his friend bade him throw the theme assigned him over the window<a name="FNanchor_827_828" id="FNanchor_827_828"></a><a href="#Footnote_827_828" class="fnanchor">[827]</a>
in a quill, and he would convey him the verses ere they were wanted. He told the
door-keeper to carry a pen-case to the lad under examination, who exhibited the
theme, and was elected. For some months Dalrymple lent him his aid in versifying.
Dr. Hallam, now Dean of Bristol and Canon of Westminster, confessed many years
after, with tears in his eyes, that next to the providence of God he owed all that he
had to the philanthropy of Sir David Dalrymple.”<a name="FNanchor_828_829" id="FNanchor_828_829"></a><a href="#Footnote_828_829" class="fnanchor">[828]</a></p></div>

<p>If, as seems likely, the examination was competitive, the boy
who did not get the scholarship might not have taken altogether
the same view of the matter as the pious and tearful dean. Dr.
Hallam was the father of the historian, and the grandfather of
Arthur Hallam. Had it not been for Lord Hailes’s good-natured
roguery the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">In Memoriam</i> might never have been written.</p>

</div>

<div class="sidenote">NEW HAILES.</div>

<p>New Hailes, as Johnson’s host told Ramsay of Ochtertyre,
“had been first made by Mr. Smith, a Popish architect employed
in fitting up King James’s chapel at the Abbey. He planted the
oldest trees. It was acquired by Lord Hailes’s grandfather, the
Lord Advocate, who gave it its present name.”<a name="FNanchor_829_830" id="FNanchor_829_830"></a><a href="#Footnote_829_830" class="fnanchor">[829]</a> We may wonder<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">{295}</a></span>
where poor Mr. Smith sought shelter that day when the news
reached Edinburgh that James II. had fled from London. He may
well have been in danger, for “the rabble,” writes Burnet, “broke
into the church of Holyrood House, which had been adorned at a
great charge to be a royal chapel, defaced it quite, and seized on
some that were thought great delinquents.”<a name="FNanchor_830_831" id="FNanchor_830_831"></a><a href="#Footnote_830_831" class="fnanchor">[830]</a> When Lord Hailes
came into the property, “his first care was to fit up the library&mdash;a
magnificent room. The furnishing of it with an ample store of
books was the great object of his ambition.”<a name="FNanchor_831_832" id="FNanchor_831_832"></a><a href="#Footnote_831_832" class="fnanchor">[831]</a> The library is now
the drawing-room&mdash;the most noble and learned drawing-room
that I have ever seen, for the great and well-filled book-shelves
still go round it from the floor almost to the lofty ceiling. If it was
in this room that Johnson was received, no doubt he behaved as he
did that April day, a year or two later, when he drove down to<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">{296}</a></span>
dine with Mr. Cambridge at Twickenham. “No sooner,” says
Boswell, “had we made our bow to Mr. Cambridge in his library
than Johnson ran eagerly to one side of the room, intent on poring
over the backs of the books.” Perhaps he turned to Lord Hailes,
as he turned to Dr. Burney, on seeing his library, and said, “You
are an honest man to have formed so great an accumulation of
knowledge.”<a name="FNanchor_832_833" id="FNanchor_832_833"></a><a href="#Footnote_832_833" class="fnanchor">[832]</a></p>

<p>The house, like so many in Scotland, is built more after the
continental than the English fashion. In the front is a square
courtyard, on a level with which are the offices. The hall is reached
by a flight of stone steps. As I came up to it a peacock was
perched on the top. Above the door is inscribed the motto,
<i lang="la" xml:lang="la">Laudo manentem</i>. Johnson’s bedroom was at one end of the house,
on the same floor as the hall; but as the ground is higher on this
side, it was on a level with the flower-garden, which was just
beneath the windows. He had also a dressing-room, whence I
looked out on pleasant hayfields, where the haymakers were hard
at work. All about the house are fine trees, many of them planted,
no doubt, by the old Popish architect; while on one side there is a
lofty grove of beeches with a column in the middle, inscribed&mdash;</p>

<p class="center">
“Joanni Comiti de Stair<br />
De Patria et Principe optime merito<br />
Viventi positum<br />
MDCCXLVI.”<br />
</p>

<p>The Earl of Stair was a Dalrymple. At the Jacobite rebellion in
1745 he had been appointed Field-Marshal and Commander-in-Chief
of the Forces in South Britain.<a name="FNanchor_833_834" id="FNanchor_833_834"></a><a href="#Footnote_833_834" class="fnanchor">[833]</a> Horace Walpole did not
think highly of his services at this time for, after describing in the
November of that year how “the Prince of Wales, the night of his
son’s christening, had the citadel of Carlisle in sugar at supper, and
the company besieged it with sugar-plums,” he continues, “One
thing was very proper; old Marshal Stair was there, who is grown
child enough to be fit to war only with such artillery.”<a name="FNanchor_834_835" id="FNanchor_834_835"></a><a href="#Footnote_834_835" class="fnanchor">[834]</a> We can
picture to ourselves Johnson walking up and down under the beech
trees, reading the inscription, and telling how kindly he had been
welcomed a few days earlier by the earl’s sister, the Countess
of Loudoun, an old lady, “who in her ninety-fifth year had all
her faculties entire. This,” adds Boswell, “was a very cheering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">{297}</a></span>
sight to Dr. Johnson, who had an extraordinary desire for long
life.”</p>

<p>With such a pleasant spot as this to live at, it is not surprising
that Lord Hailes for many years would not take a house in Edinburgh,
but resided constantly at New Hailes summer and winter
“driving in every morning in session time before breakfast, and
returning before dinner.” Dr. Alexander Carlyle, who was no bad
judge of conviviality, said, “that nowhere did he get more good
wine or more good <em>cracks</em> than from Lord Hailes.”<a name="FNanchor_835_836" id="FNanchor_835_836"></a><a href="#Footnote_835_836" class="fnanchor">[835]</a> Besides his
learning and his hospitality he had, like so many of Johnson’s
Scotch friends, deserved the praise of being a good landlord. He
did not raise his rents.<a name="FNanchor_836_837" id="FNanchor_836_837"></a><a href="#Footnote_836_837" class="fnanchor">[836]</a> <span class="sidenote">LORD HAILES’S WILL.</span> On his death his will could not be found.
He had no sons, and the heir-male was about to take possession of
his estates to the exclusion of his daughter, Miss Hailes. She had
made her preparations for leaving her old home, and had sent some
of her servants to lock up his town house in New Street. As one
of them was closing the shutters of a window the will dropped out
upon the floor from behind a panel. It was found to secure her in
the possession of the estates. She enjoyed them for upwards
of forty years.<a name="FNanchor_837_838" id="FNanchor_837_838"></a><a href="#Footnote_837_838" class="fnanchor">[837]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">LORD ELIBANK.</div>

<p>Johnson paid a visit also to Patrick, Lord Elibank, and stayed
two nights “at his seat in the country.” I at first thought that this
was Darnhall, near Peebles, and accordingly visited that most
delightful spot. But I have little doubt that it was at Ballencrieff,
in the neighbourhood of Haddington, where he stayed.<a name="FNanchor_838_839" id="FNanchor_838_839"></a><a href="#Footnote_838_839" class="fnanchor">[838]</a> Smollett,
when he takes Matthew Bramble through this part of the country,
makes him say: “I intended to pay my respects to Lord Elibank,
whom I had the honour to know at London many years ago. He
lives in this part of Lothian, but was gone to the North on a visit.
I have long revered him for his humanity and universal intelligence,
over and above the entertainment arising from the originality of his
character.”<a name="FNanchor_839_840" id="FNanchor_839_840"></a><a href="#Footnote_839_840" class="fnanchor">[839]</a> He was a Jacobite, and a member of that famous
Cocoa Tree Club, which, according to Boswell, “was sacred of old
to loyalty.” The loyalty, by the way, was rather towards the third
James than the second George. Horace Walpole tells how, after<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_298" id="Page_298">{298}</a></span>
Culloden, “the Duke of Cumberland gave Brigadier Mordaunt the
Pretender’s coach, on condition he rode up to London in it. ‘That
I will, Sir,’ said he, ‘and drive till it stops of its own accord at the
Cocoa Tree.’”<a name="FNanchor_840_841" id="FNanchor_840_841"></a><a href="#Footnote_840_841" class="fnanchor">[840]</a> Lord Elibank had been deeper in the cause than
was known at the time. According to Sir Walter Scott, the
Stuart Papers show that “he carried on a correspondence with the
Chevalier after 1745, which was not suspected by his most intimate
friends.”<a name="FNanchor_841_842" id="FNanchor_841_842"></a><a href="#Footnote_841_842" class="fnanchor">[841]</a> He probably was made to pay dearly for his attachment
to the exiled family. Lord Cromartie, one of the rebel lords,
“had been,” says Walpole, “receiver of the rents of the king’s
second son in Scotland, which it was understood he should not
account for, and by that means had six hundred pounds a year
from the Government. Lord Elibank, a very prating, impertinent
Jacobite, was bound for him in nine thousand pounds, for which the
duke is determined to sue him.”<a name="FNanchor_842_843" id="FNanchor_842_843"></a><a href="#Footnote_842_843" class="fnanchor">[842]</a> If the money was exacted, the
loss must have been severely felt, for Elibank was somewhat parsimonious.
“When he heard of John Home’s pension, he said, ‘It
is a very laudable grant, and I rejoice at it; but it is no more in
the power of the king to make John Home rich than to make me
poor.’”<a name="FNanchor_843_844" id="FNanchor_843_844"></a><a href="#Footnote_843_844" class="fnanchor">[843]</a> Perhaps when he said this he was thinking how the king
had done his best to impoverish him by exacting “the penalty and
forfeit of his bond,” and had failed.</p>

<p>One day he and Dr. Robertson called on Johnson at Boswell’s
house, and the talk turned on the Rebellion. Lord Elibank, addressing
the historian, said: “Mr. Robertson, the first thing that
gave me a high opinion of you was your saying in the Select
Society, while parties ran high, soon after the year 1745, that you
did not think worse of a man’s moral character for his having been
in rebellion. This was venturing to utter a liberal sentiment, while
both sides had a detestation of each other.” Such a sentiment
must have been particularly comforting to a man who perhaps was
still plotting treason. The Select Society had been founded in
1754 by Allan Ramsay the painter, aided by Robertson, Hume,
and Adam Smith. “It rubbed off all corners by collision,” says
Dr. Carlyle, “and made the <i lang="la" xml:lang="la">literati</i> of Edinburgh less captious and
pedantic than they were elsewhere.”<a name="FNanchor_844_845" id="FNanchor_844_845"></a><a href="#Footnote_844_845" class="fnanchor">[844]</a> If collision always rubbed
off corners, there was enough between Elibank and Hume to have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_299" id="Page_299">{299}</a></span>
produced the greatest smoothness and even polish. The historian,
in the fifth volume of his <cite>History of England</cite>, speaks of him as “a
person that has writ an <cite>Enquiry historical and critical into the
evidence against Mary Queen of Scots</cite>.” He goes on to accuse him
with having “almost directly called him a liar,” and charges him in
his turn with being guilty of “scandalous artifices.” He concludes
with that well-known passage, in which he maintains that “there
are indeed three events in our history which may be regarded as
touchstones of party-men. An English Whig, who asserts the
reality of the Popish Plot, an Irish Catholic, who denies the massacre
in 1641, and a Scotch Jacobite, who maintains the innocence
of Queen Mary, must be considered as men beyond the reach of
argument or reason, and must be left to their prejudices.”<a name="FNanchor_845_846" id="FNanchor_845_846"></a><a href="#Footnote_845_846" class="fnanchor">[845]</a> In a
letter to Robertson, written some years earlier than this note,
Hume says: “I desire my compliments to Lord Elibank. I hope
his lordship has forgot his vow of answering us, and of washing
Queen Mary white. I am afraid that is impossible; but his lordship
is very well qualified to gild her.”<a name="FNanchor_846_847" id="FNanchor_846_847"></a><a href="#Footnote_846_847" class="fnanchor">[846]</a> Hume, with all his good
nature, was not a little touchy, and perhaps took offence where no
offence was meant. Lord Elibank had been “the early patron of
Robertson and Home, the tragick poet, who when they were
ministers of country parishes, lived near his seat. He told me,”
continues Boswell, “‘I saw these lads had talents, and they were
much with me.’ I hope they will pay a grateful tribute to his
memory.” According to Dr. Carlyle, they found a far better way
of showing their gratitude, for “they cured him of his contempt for
the Presbyterian clergy, made him change or soften down many of
his original opinions, and prepared him for becoming a most
agreeable member of the Literary Society of Edinburgh, among
whom he lived during the remainder of his life, admiring and
admired.”<a name="FNanchor_847_848" id="FNanchor_847_848"></a><a href="#Footnote_847_848" class="fnanchor">[847]</a> Besides his <cite>Enquiry</cite>, he published several other “small
pieces of distinguished merit,” according to Boswell. National
Debts and the Currency were among the subjects of which he
treated.<a name="FNanchor_848_849" id="FNanchor_848_849"></a><a href="#Footnote_848_849" class="fnanchor">[848]</a> Dr. Carlyle describes him as “rather a humourist than
a man of humour; one who defended paradoxes and uncommon
opinions with a copiousness and ingenuity that was surprising.”
This part of his character would have endeared him to Johnson,
who liked a tavern because, as he said, “wine there prompts me<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">{300}</a></span>
to free conversation, and an interchange of discourse with those
whom I most love; I dogmatise and am contradicted, and in this
conflict of opinions and sentiments I find delight.”<a name="FNanchor_849_850" id="FNanchor_849_850"></a><a href="#Footnote_849_850" class="fnanchor">[849]</a> Though
Johnson was fond of his society, and once said “that he was never
in his company without learning something,” yet speaking of him
on another occasion he said, “Sir, there is nothing conclusive in
his talk.” Lord Elibank’s admiration of Johnson was very high.
Yet he need not have gone so far as to flatter him at the expense of
his own country. Having missed seeing him on his first visit to
Edinburgh, he wrote to Boswell: “I could not persuade myself
there was anything in Scotland worthy to have a summer of
Samuel Johnson bestowed on it; but since he has done us that
compliment, for heaven’s sake inform me of your motions. I will
attend them most religiously, and though I should regret to let
Mr. Johnson go a mile out of his way on my account, old as I am,
I shall be glad to go five hundred miles to enjoy a day of his company.”
Johnson, in his plain truthfulness, on the very day on
which Lord Elibank wrote this extravagant letter, said that “he
would go two miles out of his way to see Lord Monboddo.” As
five hundred to two, so perhaps was Johnson’s accuracy of talk to
Lord Elibank’s. To the mean way in which his lordship spoke of
Scotland, as if it were beneath the great Englishman’s notice, I
much prefer the spirit of his countryman, who, according to
Boswell, “would say of Dr. Johnson, ‘Damned rascal! to talk as
he does of the Scotch!’” However, he had none of that smallness
of mind common enough among the high-born, which would
not let him enjoy Johnson’s strong talk. He was “one of the
great who sought his society. He well observed that if a great
man procured an interview with him, and did not wish to see him
more, it showed a mere idle curiosity, and a wretched want of
relish for extraordinary powers of mind.” Such an idle curiosity
and such a wretched want of relish were shown by George III.</p>

<p>The old house at Ballencrieff, in which Johnson “passed two
nights and dined thrice,” as Boswell accurately records, is now a
melancholy ruin. It was burnt down about twenty years ago.
For many years previously, deserted by its owners, it had been
left in the care of a woman who lived in an outbuilding, which in
the old days had formed the kitchen. It was here, I believe, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">{301}</a></span>
were prepared those “performances of a nobleman’s French cook
which so much displeased Johnson, that he exclaimed with vehemence,
‘I’d throw such a rascal into the river.’”<a name="FNanchor_850_851" id="FNanchor_850_851"></a><a href="#Footnote_850_851" class="fnanchor">[850]</a> Though the
flames no longer roared up the chimney as they had done for many
a long year, still a fire was kept up and soot accumulated. One
day the old woman tried to get rid of it by setting it alight, a
primitive mode of chimney-sweeping not uncommon in that part of
the country. A spark, it is conjectured, was carried into the main
building through a broken pane, and falling on some straw brought
in by the birds who nested there, set an upper room on fire. The
summer had been unusually dry. The flames spread rapidly from
one end of the house to the other; so fierce was the blaze that a
large beech-tree which stood at some little distance was burnt also.
Part of the house is evidently of considerable antiquity, being very
solidly built, with vaulted chambers and walls many feet in thickness.
In the year 1625, as I
judge from an inscription on
the wall, great additions were
made. It is pleasantly placed,
with meadow-land on three
sides, and at a little distance
from a fine range of hills, which
boasts of a Roman camp and
of a lofty column to one of
Wellington’s generals. So strangely do the ages mingle here.
From the upper windows on a clear day a delightful view must
have been enjoyed of the Forth, with the little island of Inch
Keith and the hills of Fife beyond. Near the house there is a
row of yew-trees which could not have looked young in Johnson’s
time, and holly hedges leading up to it, between which, perhaps,
he walked, for they too look old. The land is in the occupation of
a market-gardener, who cultivates it with a success which would
have won his praise, and made him allow that something beside
the sloe is brought to perfection in Scotland. The whole district
abounds in fruitful gardens and orchards, and fine plantations of
trees. As I looked at the luxuriance of growth, and meditated on
the change that had been wrought in a century and a quarter, I
thought that to Johnson, who had shown the nakedness of the land,
a grateful and penitent people, who had profited by his exhortations,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">{302}</a></span>
should raise a memorial as the god of gardens. According
to a tradition which has come down to our time, a group of ash-trees
was planted by Lord Elibank on his suggestion.<a name="FNanchor_851_852" id="FNanchor_851_852"></a><a href="#Footnote_851_852" class="fnanchor">[851]</a> Planting
had begun earlier than he thought. “It may be doubted,” he said,
“whether before the Union any man between Edinburgh and
England had ever set a tree.” The market-gardener told me that
he had counted one hundred and ninety rings on some tall trees
near the house, which had been cut down fourteen years before.
This would show that they were planted not only before the Union,
but also before the Revolution, for though a ring marks the growth
of a year, yet in an old tree many of the rings cannot be distinguished.</p>

<p>As I wandered about the ruins, and listened to the jackdaws
chattering overhead “with nothing conclusive in their talk,” how
much I regretted that Boswell’s indolence had kept him from
recording the conversation which passed here in those three
November days between the old Jacobite lord and his famous
guest.</p>

<p>Johnson’s tour was rapidly drawing to a close. Brundusium
is at hand.</p>

<div class="poetry-container"><div class="poetry"><div class="stanza">
<div class="verse">“Brundusium longæ finis chartæque viæque.”<a name="FNanchor_852_853" id="FNanchor_852_853"></a><a href="#Footnote_852_853" class="fnanchor">[852]</a></div>
</div></div></div>

<div class="sidenote">SIR JOHN DALRYMPLE.</div>

<p>He wrote from Edinburgh to Mrs. Thrale on Thursday, November
18: “I long to be at home, and have taken a place in the
coach for Monday; I hope, therefore, to be in London on Friday,
the 26th, in the evening. Please to let Mrs. Williams know.” On
Saturday he accepted the invitation of Sir John Dalrymple, a cousin
of Lord Hailes, and author of <cite>Memoirs of Great Britain and
Ireland</cite>, to visit him at his house at Cranston, twelve miles from
Edinburgh on the middle road to Newcastle. There he was to be
taken up by the London coach. Three years earlier Boswell had
described Dalrymple as “a very knowing, lively companion;”<a name="FNanchor_853_854" id="FNanchor_853_854"></a><a href="#Footnote_853_854" class="fnanchor">[853]</a> but
his feelings towards him were changed. He had not worshipped
the image which he had set up. Nevertheless, “he was ambitious,”
Boswell writes, “of having such a guest; but as I was
well assured, that at this very time he had joined with some of his
prejudiced countrymen in railing at Dr. Johnson, and had said, he<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">{303}</a></span>
wondered how any gentleman of Scotland could keep company
with him, I thought he did not deserve the honour; yet, as it
might be a convenience to Dr. Johnson, I contrived that he
should accept the invitation, and engaged to conduct him.” The
convenience consisted in the fact that, as his house was on the
London road, Johnson would not have to rise so early by two
hours to catch the coach. Dalrymple had lately made a good deal
of stir both in the world of literature and politics by the publication
of his <cite>Memoirs</cite>. From these it had been learnt for the first time
that Algernon Sidney had been a pensioner of the King of France.
Horace Walpole had been roused to anger by the exposure of a
man whose memory he revered. “Need I tell you,” he wrote to
Mason, “that Sir John Dalrymple, the accuser of bribery, was
turned out of his place of Solicitor of the Customs for taking bribes
from brewers?”<a name="FNanchor_854_855" id="FNanchor_854_855"></a><a href="#Footnote_854_855" class="fnanchor">[854]</a> Hume was astonished at “the rage against him,
on account of the most commendable action in his life,” but he
despised “his ranting, bouncing style.”<a name="FNanchor_855_856" id="FNanchor_855_856"></a><a href="#Footnote_855_856" class="fnanchor">[855]</a> Johnson had an equal
contempt for it, calling it “his foppery.” Boswell records in the
spring of the year:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I mentioned Sir John Dalrymple’s <cite>Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland</cite>, and
his discoveries to the prejudice of Lord Russell and Algernon Sidney. <span class="smcap">Johnson.</span>
‘Why, Sir, every body who had just notions of government thought them rascals
before. It is well that all mankind now see them to be rascals.... This
Dalrymple seems to be an honest fellow; for he tells equally what makes against
both sides. But nothing can be poorer than his mode of writing, it is the mere
bouncing of a schoolboy: Great He! but greater She! and such stuff.’”</p></div>

<p>In describing the last scene between Lord and Lady Russell he
had said, “they parted for ever&mdash;he great in this last act of his life,
but she greater.”<a name="FNanchor_856_857" id="FNanchor_856_857"></a><a href="#Footnote_856_857" class="fnanchor">[856]</a></p>

<p>His portrait, which I saw in the Loan Exhibition of the Scottish
National Portrait Gallery, shows a cold conceited face. Dr. Carlyle
gives an unpleasing account of him. After recounting how at
a dinner he had once had “to divide a haunch of venison among
fifteen without getting any portion of fat for himself,” he continues,
“But what signifies that, when you have an opportunity of obliging
your friends? as Sir J. Dalrymple said to me one day when we
had a haunch at the Poker, flattering me for a good piece, for
he was a gourmand.”<a name="FNanchor_857_858" id="FNanchor_857_858"></a><a href="#Footnote_857_858" class="fnanchor">[857]</a> How must the indignation of this flattering<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_304" id="Page_304">{304}</a></span>
glutton have been excited at the careless and even rude treatment
which he received from our travellers, who had engaged to dine
with him on the day they left Edinburgh! They were very late in
starting, for Johnson in his good-nature had let himself be detained
“by young Mr. Tytler who came to show some essays which
he had written.” They did not leave till one o’clock, and then
Boswell insisted on their going to see Rosslyn Castle and the Chapel.
They dined and drank tea at the inn. As if this were not enough,
and as if no baronet were waiting dinner, they next went to Hawthornden,
and “had <em>Rare Ben</em> in mind” who one hundred and
forty-three years earlier had there visited the poet Drummond. “It
was very late,” writes Boswell, “before we reached the seat of Sir
John Dalrymple, who, certainly with some reason, was not in very
good humour. Our conversation was not brilliant. We supped, and
went to bed in ancient rooms, which would have better suited the
climate of Italy in summer, than that of Scotland in the month of
November.” Dalrymple was alive when this account was published.
Not finding their quarters to their mind they went on next evening
two miles further to the inn at Blackshields. Pennant, who had
passed a night there in September of the previous year,
describes “the country as good, full of corn, and decked with
numbers of small woods. The inn is good.”<a name="FNanchor_858_859" id="FNanchor_858_859"></a><a href="#Footnote_858_859" class="fnanchor">[858]</a> <span class="sidenote">A RUNAWAY COUPLE.</span> Just one year and
two days before our travellers arrived there, on November 19, 1772,
one Mr. John Scott of Newcastle had married, in this same village
and most probably in the inn, pretty Miss Elizabeth Surtees. She
had escaped by a ladder from her father’s house and had run with
him across the Border. He was twenty-one and she eighteen.
“Jack Scott,” said a friend on hearing of it, “has run off with Bessy
Surtees, and the poor lad is undone.” In the end he became Lord
Chancellor and Earl of Eldon. The certificate of marriage shows
that the ceremony was performed in the presence of James and
Thomas Fairbairn. From a paper in the <cite>Gentleman’s Magazine</cite> I
know that Fairbairn was the innkeeper’s name.<a name="FNanchor_859_860" id="FNanchor_859_860"></a><a href="#Footnote_859_860" class="fnanchor">[859]</a></p>

<div class="sidenote">THE END OF THE TOUR.</div>

<p>On the morning of Monday, November 22, the coach took up
Johnson and off he drove homewards. On the following Saturday
he wrote to Boswell from London:&mdash;“I came home last night,
without any incommodity, danger, or weariness, and am ready
to begin a new journey. I shall go to Oxford on Monday.” There<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_305" id="Page_305">{305}</a></span>
he met Mr. John Scott and his young bride, and perhaps compared
notes about Blackshields and the Newcastle road.<a name="FNanchor_860_861" id="FNanchor_860_861"></a><a href="#Footnote_860_861" class="fnanchor">[860]</a> To his friend,
Dr. Taylor, he wrote that “he had traversed the east coast of
Scotland from south to north, from Edinburgh to Inverness, and
the west-coast from north to south, from the Highlands to
Glasgow.”<a name="FNanchor_861_862" id="FNanchor_861_862"></a><a href="#Footnote_861_862" class="fnanchor">[861]</a></p>

<p>“The time he spent in his Tour, was,” he often said, “the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_306" id="Page_306">{306}</a></span>
pleasantest part of his life.” I too have rarely spent my time more
pleasantly than when I was following his traces both in that
beautiful country through which he wandered, and in those old
books in which still live the people, the manners, and the Scotland
which he saw.</p>

1776, published without a name, but written by
Captain Edward Topham, pp. 137-140. Arnot,
in his <cite>History of Edinburgh</cite>, p. 361, after ridiculing
Topham’s statement, that golf is played
on the top of Arthur’s Seat, continues: “These
letters are written with spirit and impartiality.
But the facts and criticisms contained in them
are for the most part equally ill-founded. Yet
so candid is the author amidst his errors, that it
is hard to say whether he is more erroneous
when he speaks in praise or censure of the
Scottish nation.” It is possible and perhaps
probable that he has exaggerated the ill-will
against Johnson. The passage which he puts in
quotation marks is not in the <cite>Journey</cite>.</p></div>

one week there were six criminals under sentence

tailor’s shop. By the kindness of the heads of the
firm, Messrs. Lauder and Hardie, I was shown
over the building. Though it has been a good
deal altered for the purposes of business it is still
substantially the same solid stone house which
Hume in his prosperity built for the closing years
of his life. The rooms are lofty, being about
fourteen feet high. The kitchen and the cellars
were evidently contrived for a man who intended
to boast with justice of his dinners and his wine.
From the windows of every floor there must have
been an uninterrupted view of the shores of Fife,
across the Firth of Forth, and of the house in
Kirkaldy, where Adam Smith was living.</p></div>

Perhaps this was Jeremy Bentham’s father, who
two years earlier had married for the second
time: what was his wife’s Christian name I have
not been able to ascertain. The son did not
visit Edinburgh in 1768. Dr. Chambers gives
on p. 318 a list of the great people living in the
Canongate about the year 1769. According to
it there were two dukes, sixteen earls, two
countesses, seven barons, seven lords of session,
thirteen baronets, and four commanders-in-chief.

great pleasure that this interesting but ruinous
old building will not only be preserved, but preserved
to good uses. It has been purchased by
Dr. A. H. F. Barbour and his sister Mrs. Whyte,
and by them presented to the Edinburgh Social
Union. It will be put into a state of thorough
repair, and let out to poor tenants on the plan
followed by Miss Octavia Hill in London. I
am informed that the two sides of the Close had
been repaired by the Social Union before my
visit, and that the pleasant outside staircases
and open galleries which caught my eye were
its work.</p></div>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions will
be renamed.

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm
concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark,
and may not be used if you charge for the eBooks, unless you receive
specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

START: FULL LICENSE

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg-tm License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works

1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the
person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph
1.E.8.

1.B. "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the
Foundation" or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work
on which the phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original "Plain
Vanilla ASCII" or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg-tm License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
